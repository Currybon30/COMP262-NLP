      "Text: Powerful and fast is the best way I can describe the cooktop on GE's new Induction Range. It is so incredible it even surpassed all my expectations. It boils water so fast you don't even have time to get the food ready to go in before the lids rattling off the pot. Yet it heats so low that you can melt a large bar of chocolate directly in a pan without having to use a double boiler! It will have it melted and ready to use in 15 minutes, and you can leave it on for hours without worrying about it scorching. Now that's versatility! And the temperature change response time is instant. You can take that pot of boiling water with the lid rattling and reduce the heat to simmer, and the water instantly stops boiling and goes to a gentle simmer in a second. I don't mean in a few seconds. I mean right now! This thing blows gas away so bad it's not even funny. I've used both gas and electric, and gas being the closest contender doesn't even hold a candle to the power and speed of this induction cooktop. Now I can already hear the nay sayers out there saying no way, gas is the best. But seeing is believing. And this thing is truly amazing. That's not all though. It has even more tricks.<br /><br />I use both cast iron and tri-ply stainless steel cookware on it. The stainless cookware gets used directly on the glass cooktop, but I'm afraid to use the cast iron on it for fear of scratching it. So I place a paper towel between the cast iron and the cooktop. You read correctly. I'm cooking on paper towels! Since the cooktop doesn't generate any heat at all, and the only heat the cooktop receives is the heat reflected back to the cooktop from the cooking utensil itself it doesn't get hot enough to ignite the paper towel. Then when I'm done cooking I use the paper towel to clean up the cooktop. This is a cinch because the cooktop doesn't get hot enough to burn anything on it anyway. Just a simple wipe with a damp paper towel or sponge and a quick sprits of window cleaner and the thing looks brand new again. I've found that a good streak free window cleaner works the best at keeping it looking new<br /><br />The induction elements will make your cookware perform at the highest level it can. Since the utensil itself is the actual heating element instead of a wire coil or a ring of flame, there are absolutely no hot spots in the cooking utensil. As long as the utensil fits close to the size of the element circle, it will heat perfectly uniformly from edge to edge. The electro-magnetic energy field extends ½\" beyond and above the element, so my 12\" cast iron or stainless steel skillet heats perfectly edge to edge on the 11\" element. And my 10 X 20\" reversible cast iron grill/griddle works too despite the fact that the rim holds it about ¼\" above the cooktop. It still fits within the range that the electro-magnetic field will respond to. And yes, I cook with it on top of paper towels since it is cast iron. It cooks very well spanned across the two 8\" elements on the left side as long as you give it at least 15 minutes to warm up so the heat can spread out across it. The utensil size does not have to perfectly match the size of the element circle as the electro-magnet will automatically adjust to various sizes within a given range. And none of the element outside that range gets hot. Only the utensil gets hot. Think of it in the same way that a microwave gets only the food hot, the induction element gets only the cooking utensil hot. Not the food in the utensil or the cooktop itself, just the utensil. And in turn the heat of the utensil cooks the food that's in it just like it does on any other cooktop. It's just a microwave for your pots and pans! You can read all about how it works at this website: [...]. The 11\" element can be used on a utensil with a bottom diameter as small as 7\". The two 8\" elements can go as small as 5 ¾\", and the 6\" as small as 4 ¾\". You can also use a utensil larger than the element as well. I use a 14\" cast iron pizza pan as a griddle on the 11\" element and all but about the outer 1 ½\" of the pan are evenly heated. The heat tapers off somewhat around the outer perimeter.<br /><br />This thing is really built too. Weighing in at 240 pounds, it outweighs the Samsung induction range by 32 pounds and the Kenmore induction range by a whopping 50 pounds! We're talking impressive build quality here. The stainless steel is a very nice quality and is easy to keep looking good.<br /><br />The control panel is a one piece glass touch panel with no knobs. It responds very well to touch and is easy to use. There is a slight learning curve since you're cooking by number instead of turning a knob. But I adapted quickly to it and don't even think about it anymore. There are 19 steps from low to high for each element. All 4 induction elements are high power and have a \"boost\" cycle that makes them quite capable of boiling a pot of water very quickly.  There is also a fifth element that is a warming burner. It's a 120 watt electric radiant burner (not induction) with three settings, hi, med, and low. It is not designed to heat anything up, just to keep already hot things warm.<br /><br />I haven't had much of a chance to use the oven yet, but from what little I've used it, it seems to work well. It has three heavy enamel coated racks that you can leave in the oven during self cleaning. That's a big plus because those big racks don't fit in the sink, so your only other option would be to wash them in the bathtub or take them outside. I've done it both ways with our old stove and neither is fun. So I'm happy I don't have to do that anymore with these. They also slide very easily in the oven too and there are six positions for them. This oven uses what is called True European Convection. Meaning that there is a third element around the fan itself. During convection cooking only this element is used and the fan blows and circulates heated air into the oven cavity. This particular system also reverses itself every 70 seconds which is supposed to aid greatly in the evenness of the temperature throughout the oven cavity. I have read that it works quite well so I can only assume great results when I really get a chance to use it. It also comes with a temperature probe that will come in quite handy when cooking whole birds, hams, and roasts. The convection fan is fairly quiet too. Much quieter than the one on my convection microwave. There's also a small fan in the cooktop that cycles on and off occasionally to keep the electronics in there cool. That too is very quiet and goes unnoticed quickly if even noticed at all. The kitchen has to be pretty quiet to hear it.<br /><br />I have only had it a few weeks but so far I love it. The only problem I have had, if you can call it a problem, was trying to figure out a particular feature it has. If you own one of these or are going to buy one this may be of interest to you. If not interested, you may want to skip this and move on to the next paragraph. So here goes. I asked three different people at GE, the local rep, the email tech support, and the phone tech support and nobody had an answer for me, so I had to just figure it out myself. You see, the convection oven has a feature called \"Convection Conversion\". The user manual is written for many different models, but doesn't cover \"convection conversion\". It does however talk about \"Auto Recipe Conversion\" which is basically the same thing. They differ though in how the end result is executed. Both features when set to \"on\" are designed to automatically reduce the convection cooking temperature by 25 degrees since convection cooking is more efficient than conventional baking. This way you can just follow the standard temperature in a recipe, cook with convection and the temperature reduction is automatically taken care of for you. Sounds easy enough right? Well, according to the manual under \"auto recipe conversion\", (remember, there is no mention of \"convection conversion\") when you set say 350 deg and press start, you are supposed to see it say on the display, CON, 325 (the -25 deg thing) and then go to pre-heat. When it reaches 325 deg it will signal it's ready. But mine doesn't do that. If I set 350, there is no CON, 325. It just goes to pre-heat and signals it's ready at 350. So where's -25 deg's I'm supposed to be seeing? One GE rep said it was broken and wanted to schedule to have it fixed. I said no, I'll do some further checking myself before fixing something that may not be broke. The one at the store wasn't plugged in, so I couldn't see how that one worked either. So I decided to test it with my infrared thermometer since I don't have an oven thermometer to see if the actual temperature was 25 deg lower than indicated when convection conversion was set to on. Sure enough, with it set to 350 deg (and showing 350 deg on the display) it was actually 325 deg in the oven according to the infrared thermometer. When I turned the convection conversion off, the temp in the oven went all the way to 350 deg. Problem solved. And I prevented a repair man from tearing my new stove apart only to discover that it did the same exact thing again when he was done. Amazing that nobody at GE had the answer for me though. I guess this is a \"new\" feature that hasn't made it into the books yet, or anywhere else for that matter. Anyway, hopefully this has answered the question for someone else reading this that may be wondering the same thing too.<br /><br />I am very happy I got this range. I had my heart set on getting the GE Café model because I really like the up-front controls and the pro look. But then I read the article in Consumer Reports on ranges and read about the induction cooktop. This induction range was about the same price as the GE Café model too. I had never even heard of induction before so I decided to do some research on it. Turns out induction has been around for about 30 years! In Europe, it out sells both gas and electric cooktops. It is also 90% energy efficient too because most of your energy goes directly into the cookware instead of heating the air. So your kitchen will stay much cooler in the summer too. It is far safer since there is no heat and no flame. And the element turns off automatically when the utensil is removed for a period of time (30 sec in my case), so there's no accidentally left on burners to burn your house down! So why hasn't it caught on here yet? The cookware. It requires cookware that is ferrous (magnetic) and apparently Americans are put off that they might have to replace their cookware for it. Therefore, very few company's here even sell induction cooktops let alone ranges, so the price for it remains fairly high. But thankfully that's starting to change and the prices are coming down to a more affordable level now. I believe that once people realize how great induction is they will get over this cookware thing and latch onto it. Induction is the next big thing since the microwave! It is well worth investing in some new cookware if you have to. Your cookware may already work anyway. If a magnet will stick to the bottom of your cookware, it is induction ready. If not, there is plenty of inexpensive cookware you can buy that will work.  Try Ikea's 365+ line for starters.<br /><br />I am so glad I read the article about the new ranges. If I hadn't, I would have spent the same money and bought the Café with an electric radiant cooktop since I can't get natural gas where I currently live and propane is not even an option to me (used them, don't like how they perform). Then I would have missed the boat on this wonderful technology. I believe in the next decade induction will be the next big thing here too. Let's hope.<br /><br />Update:  I have added a video review on YouTube.  If you go to YouTube and type \"GE Induction Range Water Boil Test\" in the search bar, it should be the first video that comes up.  (Amazon won't allow me to post a link to it here.)<br /><br />11 Month Update:<br /><br />After using this range for the last 11 month's I am happy to report that I still absolutely LOVE it! I have had no problems with it at all and we've since moved it into a new house. (New to us anyway). The speed of heating, instant temperature change response time, and heat uniformity across the pan are phenomenal. The glass cooktop looks as good as the day it was new. It is so easy to keep clean because it doesn't get hot enough to burn anything on it. You can clean up spills instantly while you're cooking because of this. And when you're done, a few spray's of glass cleaner and a paper towel and your cooktop looks like new again!<br /><br />The element layout and size on this GE Range are perfect as well. I noticed a person mentioned that on their Samsung induction range their utensils had to be just the right size and perfectly centered, and if you bumped them off center or removed them from the cooktop for even a moment the element would turn off. Not so with the GE. Your cookware doesn't have to be centered at all and the element will just find and follow them.  As long as you have at least the center of the element covered, it will locate and follow the pan as you move it around. The element will turn off automaticallyif the utensil is removed, but only after over 30 seconds from being removed. This gives you plenty of time to pick up and shake your food around the pan and set it back down without having to turn it back on. Also, a wide range of sizes can be used on the various elements. These elements are just not that picky.<br /><br />There's a cooling fan in the cooktop to keep things cool in there that comes on from time to time.  But it is so quiet that it quickly goes unnoticed.  If your exhaust fan is on you'll probably never even hear it.  Sometimes, depending on the utensil you will get a little buzzing sound.  But that usually goes away after a few minutes.  At any rate it's not annoying and is normal for this type of cooktop.  Another aspect of induction cooking that you quickly appreciate is the fact that the setting used on one burner is exactly the same as on another burner.  So if you're cooking something on a front burner on say 3 1/2, and you want to move it to a back burner so you can use that burner for something else, you just set the back burner on 3 1/2 and it is exactly the same setting as the front burner.  And with no warm up time whatsoever!  Because the pan is the part generating the heat, not the element.  And the pan is already hot.  The frequency from the magnet just keeps it that way.  Same frequency = same heat.<br /><br />The oven works equally well too.  It cooks evenly and predictably.  It's a little slow to warm up but not annoyingly so.  And when using convection you don't have to wait for it to fully warm up anyway.  The oven is very well insulated too.  I've used the self clean feature 3 times now and this range doesn't get nearly as hot to the touch as other ranges I've used in the past.  Although I'd still remove anything from the cooktop when self cleaning.  The three oven racks are finished in the same enamel finish as the oven interior so I just leave them in while the cleaning is being done.  This is a real time saver compared to my old range because I don't have to clean (read scrub!) the oven racks anymore.  The enamel interior and racks still look like brand new after three cleanings.  Just a wipe with a wet wash cloth to wipe the ash out is all that is needed after cleaning.  I wipe the edges of the racks with a little olive oil and they glide like new.  I expect the oven and racks will hold up for a long time to come.<br /><br />I just can't say enough good about this range. It has been a wonderful tool to use for cooking. And the stainless steel pot's and pan's set I bought 11 month's ago to use on it still look like new because the induction cooktop is so easy on them. No hot spots, no burnt on food on the bottom, and no flames to discolor them. When I think of all the people that turn away from these induction cooktops because they don't want to buy new cookware I just shake my head.  Cookware that works on these doesn't have to be expensive as anything that a magnet will stick to will work.  It is a very small price to pay for such an exceptional cooking tool.  No other cooktop at any price can compete with the performance of a good induction cooktop.  That has been proven time and time again. Gas can't boil water anywhere near as fast, nor can it simmer anything as low. And electric doesn't even hold a candle to this technology.  These have been selling in Europe for over 30 years now and have been exceptionally reliable.  And why not, it's just an electromagnet with very little heat around it comparatively to cause failure.  It's just so simple it's amazing.<br /><br />20 Month Update:<br /><br />It's been 20 month's now since I bought this range and it still looks and performs as good as the day it was new.  I have had 0 problems with it.  There are a couple of tiny scratches in the cooktop now but you have to look very closely to find them.  Really, only a person cleaning the cooktop would ever even notice them.  Also, the front edge of the brushed Stainless Steel that borders the cooktop is showing a little wear from things getting drug across it.  But again you have to look closely to notice it.  These are just the signs of a well loved range that gets used.  And they are really only noticeable to the person cleaning it because you are looking for imperfections to polish out.  You'd never even notice them by just looking at the stove.<br /><br />The glass touch control panel and the oven still look and perform flawlessly.  I have cleaned the oven about 6 times now using the self clean feature and it comes out looking like new every time.  Just a little wipe out of the remaining ash with a damp rag is all that is needed after the clean cycle is done.  The enamel finish on the oven and on the racks still looks like new.  No signs of dulling or chipping as some have mentioned happening with \"other\" brands.  And the enamel coated racks are WONDERFUL because you can just leave them in during the clean cycle and they come out looking great.  No more having to remove the racks before self cleaning and take them outside to scrub on them as I had to do with chrome racks in my previous range.  I just remove the racks when the cleaning is done, wipe the remaining ash residue off with a damp rag and apply a little cooking oil to the side edges of the racks and the rack guides on the oven walls and they slide in and out with ease again.<br /><br />I still love this range and would never go back to a conventional electric or gas range unless there was no other option.  For the money there is nothing that even comes close in performance to this range even from ranges costing thousands more, gas or electric.  Even among the latest Induction Ranges available here in the US, from what I've read about them I still feel that this GE model is the best of the best.  And two years in, the latest model from GE is still unchanged from the one that I own.  However, they have added a \"slide in\" version now of this marvelous range for those that require it.  It appears to be exactly the same as mine except that the control panel is on the front edge.  Very cool.\n",

      "Review 1497750:\n",
      "Text: Update: I have been using this ice maker for several months now. So, I wanted to update this review, because I am using this differently now.  Basically, I was over complicating things at first, mostly based on my prior few years of using a particular counter top cube ice maker.  After a while, I realized I was over complicating things and I wanted to clarify that for the product’s sake and any possible future readers.<br /><br />Truthfully, I am really just using it now more along the lines of how they designed it, so… duh me.  I apologize to the manufacturer/seller if I confused anyone with my overcomplicated approach.  So, to prevent this for possible future readers, I will describe my current usage and my related usage recommendations after my prior review below.<br /><br />I will say that after 4 months of owning and using this ice maker, I still like it very much, if not even more.  Regarding quality, I still believe this is a great little machine for my needs.  I’ve been using it daily for a couple of months and have had no problems at all.<br /><br />The following is my prior review of the product itself, which still applies, with a few changes/updates…<br /><br />The quality of the company, as well as the product, both appear to be great.  I’m very pleased with the quality of the product for sure.<br /><br />The product manual is nice and way better than most of the products you purchase online.  The packing was very clever, as I really liked how they designed the box to just life off the ice maker and the base, instead of having to lift it out of the box.  It’s a bit heavy and so I thought that was a rather clever solution for making it easier to unbox.<br /><br />The design quality appears to be nice as well.  It appears they thought through various important use cases and designed accordingly.  As a result, using the product appears to be fairly simple and the features appear to flow well; such as, the way it handles warnings for a full basket or out of water.  It appears to understand a little better what to do while you are addressing the issue and after you have done so.  For example, when it throws the out of water alarm state, and you lift the lid to empty the ice and refill the front reservoir, it appears to wait to re-start ice production until you close the lid again.  (Note: This is mostly true, but there are occasions where it’s a bit more smart/complicated than that). As a result, you can remove the ice or the  basket and pour more water in without making a mess or melting the ice in the basket by pouring water through it.  Which is nicer than cube models I have used in the past.  Also, when I first powered the unit on, it went straight into a clean cycle for me, which if you follow the instructions, you will be prepared to do.  I guess they hope to prod the lazy customer to be sure to run a cleaning cycle before use.  Little stuff like that shows that they actually thought about how to handle these things in a more helpful way for the user.<br /><br />And I really like that it has a self cleaning function, although that seems to be a feature that’s growing in popularity, as I saw it on other machines as well.  Not sure how well that works on other machines, but it was rather painless on mine.  So, I find that nice to have.  Note: I didn’t notice any direction in the manual regarding how often to run the cleaning cycle.  Perhaps I just missed it, of course.  In the absence of that direction, I just run the cleaning every few weeks or so.  I use 7 stage pre-filtered, very soft water, so I believe I am fine with this approach.  Perhaps the manufacturer has better recommendations for that, of course).<br /><br />I’m impressed with the output rate.  Pellet/Nugget ice makers, and the related process to produce this type of ice, are notoriously known for slow production rates.  This also includes higher end under-cabinet units.  It’s just a slow way to make ice.  To get this rate of production for pellet ice in a unit at this low cost point is pretty impressive, in my opinion.  It’s not crazy fast of course, but I was stunned to see it start spitting out ice in just a few minutes.  Granted, it creates the ice slowly a few at a time at a constant rate.  But, in an hour, it makes enough ice to fill 2 or 3 average drinking glasses.  For pellet ice, that’s rather nice.  Personally, I think that their approach to the process for creating the ice appears to be rather clever.<br /><br />Having said that, for us, there’s just my wife and me, and occasionally others visiting.  If you have a large family or lots of guests or whatever, you might need to run it constantly to keep up, maybe opt to use the optional water supply tap, if you like the quality of your household water.  Or start earlier before you need it.  Or maybe run it over night.  Or make some ahead of time and store it in the freezer, which can be done if needed.  It’s not quite as a good as the fresh ice, but I’ll offer a tip about this at the end of this review.<br /><br />Keep in mind that cube based ice makers are a bit faster by volume of ice; however, pellet ice is denser and weighs more by volume.  So, I think it’s a bit skewed to compare them by weight of the ice.<br /><br />Regarding cost, I’m quite pleased.  Really, given the quality of this product and the rate of ice production, it’s a great achievement at this price point.  In my case, it was on a moderate sale when we bought it AND they had an in-cart coupon that we used and got a great price as a result.  They appear to have dropped the price on this machine a bit anyway, so maybe it will stay lower into the future.<br /><br />Regarding loudness, which someone complained about… I used cube based counter top machines prior to this.  Sure, this might be a bit louder, as far as the hum level.  Not much, if it is.  We keep ours in the kitchen, so sure you notice it a bit when you’re in the kitchen and it’s running.  But, outside the kitchen you barely hear it, and after a short distance from the kitchen, you really can’t hear it at all.  This is very similar to the prior cube machine we had.  If this is louder, it’s not by much.<br /><br />That said, a sound problem this one does NOT have… is that loud-ish crash that cube based machines make every 15 mins or so, when they drop a sheet of ice.  With those, I couldn’t run them very late, because they would wake up my wife.  This one, I can run anytime and it’s no problem.  Other than the hum which she can’t really hear in the bedroom, the only sound it makes is a teeny little tick when it spits out ice pellets, which you can barely hear unless you are right at the machine. So, I would say this is BETTER sound wise, even if it is a little bit louder than my prior, cheaper cube based machine.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind… this is a higher quality machine, in my opinion.  At least higher than what I had previously.  Part of that is reflected by the fact that it actually has a somewhat larger or more powerful or higher end compressor, or however you want to think about better compressor-ness.  As a result, maybe it’s a bit louder.  But, if you want faster ice production for pellet ice, well… it requires better compressor-ness.  I imagine that’s a trade off, right.  Cheaper machine, maybe it’s quieter, but less productive.  Personally, I like how it performs enough to not care that it may be a little bit louder.  Perhaps if you sleep close to it or spend your day near it, then the hum might be a bit distracting.  But the same is the case for any counter top ice machine that I’ve had.  Also, if you left it run constantly, it will stop when it’s full or out of water, until you get more ice and it starts a new cycle.  So, it doesn’t run and make sound all the time, which might help if the noise is a concern for you.<br /><br />One thing in favor of using these machines that most folks may not think of… it may reduce the maintenance needs on your fridge.  Around late 2020, in the COVID era, we had to buy a new fridge.  Product availability was very limited across the entire industry and, while the manufacturers provide warranty services, actually getting services providers to your house could be a long time to never, depending on the manufacturer.  After some research, I discovered that the number one reason for maintenance calls is to service the ice making systems.  I found statistics claiming that on average, new fridges require 2 maintenance visits in the first year for ice maker related issues.  This included expensive fridge models and was particularly the case with in-door ice dispensers for French door models.  I guess the concept of freezing ice in “warmer” fridge temps is inherently problematic.  Regardless, since we use a stand alone ice system, we usually just turn the fridge’s ice maker off.  We bought a cheaper model fridge, not by choice, but due to availability, so I was somewhat concerned that it would have issues.  We specifically picked one without an in-door ice dispenser and with the ice machine in the freezer area only, then just turned off the fridge’s ice maker.  We’ve had no issues with the fridge, and while we don’t know for certain that’s because of using an external ice maker, for sure it is less stress on the fridge components by using an external ice maker.<br /><br />One final plus for me with this machine… cost savings.  Because I don’t want to use city water, in the past, I have resorted to getting bagged ice.  This can be problematic in several ways, depending on where you get your ice from.<br /><br />Cost wise, it only costs me about 30 cents to make about 5 lbs of ice, which is what we roughly use per day.  This is much cheaper than your retail stores.<br /><br />Plus,  I KNOW where the water came from AND who handled it.  When I would buy ice previously at grocery stores and what not, after I got them home, I would often find holes in the bag that I missed at the store.  After COVID became a thing, it would bother me wondering who at a Walmart or wherever had handled my ice with holes in the bag.  I’m not hugely concerned about COVID, specifically.  But that era raised my awareness at least relating to stuff like that, so… Yikes.  Anyway, that’s a big win for me, regardless.<br /><br />Ok, those are some reasons that I like this machine.  Having said all that, I’ve been using counter top ice machines for a few years and have learned several things that may help with using them, as well as help set appropriate expectations.  I’ll share some of those here, including some possible “cons”, depending on your needs.  These might also address some concerns from other reviews.  I do not believe these are major problems, but it may be good to be aware of them.<br /><br />Con… There’s a small amount of time in operating and maintaining the machine.  You can definitely use it infrequently to just make some pellet ice for a particular occasion.  However, to work any appliance into your daily routine will require a bit of time for usage and maintenance.  So, if you want to use it to have pellet ice constantly, just know that there is a bit of time involved in using and maintaining the machine.<br /><br />For me, I am motivated to use systems like this, because it is VERY IMPORTANT to me to make ice using “my own water”.  I realized quite a while ago that I have issues with “city water”.  Now, I only use certain forms of filtered water.  I use this for ALL my potable water needs… drinking, cooking, espresso machines, making my own carbonated water… and ICE.  The cheap 2 stage filters that fridges use for ice and drinking water are not sufficient, and my wife and I both have issues with water and ice from “city water”.  So, I’m very motivated to make ice that doesn’t give me issues like city water.  Using this device and the related efforts around doing so, doesn’t seem like a big deal TO ME.  Plus, it’s much cheaper than purchasing bagged ice.  However, your need and usage, and ultimately your motivation, may differ.<br /><br />Con… it’s a bit heavy.  Is it TOO heavy or REAL heavy?  Definitely not.  Is it heavier than my prior cube making system… somewhat, yes.  So, again back to better compressor-ness… I get why it’s a bit heavier, given better quality and output needs for this type of ice.  I also think the basket is somewhat larger than the cube machine’s was.  However, I was a bit surprised at how heavy it is.  Again, not majorly so.  But, if you are someone with back issues or strength challenges, keep in mind that you will be moving this with some frequency in order to drain it.  Unless you run it near some kind of draining solution, like beside your sink or whatever, in which case you may not have it to move it very often.  Personally, I have to move it to my kitchen sink to drain it.  How frequently you move it, varies.  If you run it constantly, then they suggest that you drain it daily.  I do drain it daily, as I mention after this review.  Draining it is very simple and easy, and only takes a few minutes, but again, if you have back issues or strength challenges, you might want to keep this in mind.<br /><br />Possible con, depending on needs… Long term storage of the ice.  So, yeah, it loads ice into an insulated compartment, similar to a small ice chest, but which is not a freezing solution or something that can maintain a freezing environment.  This is true.  However, it is true for all counter top ice makers, since they are not freezers, but ice makers.<br /><br />Plus, folks have noted that if you move the ice to a freezer, it will freeze into a hard block, since it is wet.  This is also true.  There is a solution to this that I use, depending on your motivation level.  But keep in mind a few things relating to this.<br /><br />First, if you hard freeze it, then it becomes hard and less chewable.  So, taking the ice directly from the ice maker’s basket to use in your drink, provides soft, chewable ice, because it has NOT been hard frozen.  In this regard, by dumping the ice into the basket in an insulated compartment that is NOT a low temp freezing solution, is a benefit.<br /><br />Secondly, the machine is likely designed to operate constantly, based on verbiage in the manual and online.  I run it daily, though not over night.  However, you can opt to use the external water tap connector and run it constantly.  If you do so, then they recommend changing the water every 24 hours, which means draining it daily.  I now drain this machine daily as part of my routine, but I don’t find it to be too much hassle.  Just a few minutes at night as part of my routine with my other equipment, so doesn’t bother me much, really.<br /><br />So, that’s my review and thoughts on the machine.  Now, here’s how I currently use this ice machine.<br /><br />I do store and keep some ice in the freezer on standby for certain situations.  However, mostly, I just run the machine daily and let it just “do its thing”.  Here’s specifically how I use it…<br /><br />I start the machine in the morning and just let it run throughout the day.  Within an hour, there is enough ice for 2 or more full glasses, which is plenty for our early drinks.  After a few hours, the machine will fill up with ice and trigger a “full” status or an “out of water” status, depending on how much water you added initially, of course.  The point it is that it stops running once those states are triggered.  Depending on how much ice we use during this period, this can take 2.5 hours or more.<br /><br />What’s nice about the “full” state is that it will stay off until you get more ice.  Basically, as you open the lid and get ice, when you close the lid again, it will start a sequence to see if it needs to make more ice and if it has water to do so.  If so, it will run for a while, depositing fresh ice on top, until it is full again or runs out of water.  It’s been very reliable and I’ve had no issues with it not detecting either state.<br /><br />As ice melts during the day, it will recycle the water to make more ice again as you use it.  There are two benefits I really like about this.<br /><br />First, I like that it doesn’t run all the time.  For folks that think the hum is not desirable, at least it runs intermittently as you use it, then it stops.<br /><br />Secondly, I like that it DOES NOT start a new ice sequences requently.  Instead, it waits for you to open the door and get ice, then it checks to see if it can or should make more ice.  The nice thing about this, is that it thinks along the lines of, “If they aren’t using the ice, why make more ice needlessly?”.  It follows a usage based feedback cycle, so that it doesn’t use energy needlessly.<br /><br />The exception is if enough water melts, it may start a cycle on its own.  I’ve only noticed it doing this a few times, so not sure what the specific parameters are that trigger this.  Is it just if the water level increases over a certain level?  Or every so often it checks the water level?  Regardless, it’s not often or constant.<br /><br />When I’m doing my final routines at night before bed, I put any remaining ice in the machine into a small plastic bowl with a lid in the FRIDGE, NOT the freezer.  This is so that in the morning, when the machine is just starting to make ice, I have enough soft ice to use until there’s new ice in the machine’s basket.  I generally have 2 to 6 cups of ice left at night, depending on how much we used that day, of course.  In the morning, there will be some collected water from ice melting in the bottom of the bowl in the fridge.  I just pour out the water and the ice is fine, soft like when it was freshly made.  Sometimes I use the melted water for drinking, because it’s the same water I keep in the fridge for drinking anyway.  And it’s very cold, which is nice.<br /><br />Also, at night, after removing the ice from the machine, I drain the machine, rinse the basket, then fill the machine back up with water and put the basket back in, but leave it unplugged.  So, in the morning, I just have to plug it back in.<br /><br />Once every few weeks or so, I run the cleaning the cycle.  I use with very soft, filtered water, so I don’t have frequent issues with scaling or those kinds of things. I mentioned, there’s no guidance in the manuals that I have noticed about how often you should run a cleaning cycle.  While I do start with clean water, they do recommend that you empty the water daily if you use it constantly.  And I’ve noticed little particles in the water after time, just from dust and things in the air as you open and close the lid, get ice, etc.  So, I drain it every night, since they recommend it and just to make sure it isn’t gathering dust or whatever as you use it.<br /><br />This has been much simpler than focusing solely on keeping ice in the freezer. Basically, I always have soft frozen ice on hand.<br /><br />We have a couple of Gaggia super/fully automatic espresso machines,  a CO2 device for making carbonated water, etc, so I have a bit of a nightly maintenance process for all of that anyway.  Adding this machine to that process is rather mundane and only takes a few minutes; and, I don’t have to mess with it during the day at all, other than to plug it in, first thing in the morning.<br /><br />Well, that’s what we’re doing now and I find it much simpler.\n",

      "Review 506771:\n",
      "Text: I've had one of these since mid-March 2015, purchased locally from a big-box store.<br /><br />First thing to say: I love it. Absolutely _love_ it.<br /><br />Second thing: It's not for everyone. It's _different_ from regular washing/drying, you have to learn how to use it (takes maybe a week's worth of laundry to start figuring how to get the best out of it), and your circumstances may be different from mine and you might not love it, depending.<br /><br />The best parts:<br /><br />- Throwing in dry clothes, having them come out clean and pretty much dry. They're not bone-dry, but dry enough to hang, fold and put up. Usually they are steam-damp, and a quick shake before a fold or a hang fixes that. If the clothes aren't coming out dry enough (as some reviewers claim), you're probably either packing the machine too full, or haven't figured out which setting makes them dry enough for you, or are thinking about the one heavy piece in a load of light stuff, or are expecting bone-dry. I chalk up the slight moisture to the better fabric care this washer/dryer provides - I think it's part of the reason my clothes are less wrinkled. But yes, this is different from a conventional dryer, and you should expect the difference. Hasn't put me off it. Maybe if I lived in an area with very high humidity all the time, or had no air conditioning, this would be an issue, but it's not for me.<br /><br />- Tumbles the clothes every few minutes while it waits for you to come get 'em. That is so cool, and it really works to keep them from getting way wrinkled. Wish it'd do so forever 'till I opened the door - you only get about 4 hours of tumble to get 'em out before tumbling stops, and I suppose they've done it this way 'cause you could go on vacation and leave it tumbling, but still, why not 8 hours?<br /><br />- Simple to work once you get used to it: the lights and settings are a bit much at first, but you can set a &#34;preferred program&#34; you can access with one touch of a button. I have my usual wash program set up on the button, turn the washer on, touch the button, load the clothes, detergent and go. Keys to getting the best out of the machine:<br /><br />1. Don't overfill (there's plenty of room in the drum, but you can't pack it tight and expect dry clothes at the end)<br />2. Expect to shake the steam out of your dried clothes at the end of the cycle - takes no time at all: give a shirt a shake and hang it<br />3. For fabrics that can't be dried, do a wash cycle without a dry, pull your un-dryable stuff out, then do a dry cycle (see below)<br />4. Try and get fabrics that are about the same heaviness for your load. You don't have to be precise, but if you put one pair of jeans in with a load of sheets, the jeans will come out damp.<br />5. Use enough detergent, but not too much - doesn't take a ton. Too much will make your clothes smell like the detergent (more than you'd like).<br /><br />- Washes and dries my clothes while I sleep, tumbles 'em 'til I get up to keep wrinkles out. Some think the &#34;long&#34; cycle times are a problem. For me, the &#34;long&#34; times aren't considerably longer than a wash and a dry, and I don't have to handle wet clothes in-between. I set a load at night, set the delay time to have the clothes ready when I get up, and don't think about it 'til morning. This isn't the only way to do it, but if I need a particular set of clothes for the morning, and start late at night, I can get the machine to reliably handle the problem, have it go away 'til I'm ready for the clean clothes. Love this. Love it.<br /><br />- No dryer lint-trap to have to empty every load. There's a lint filter in the wastewater line you have to empty about monthly, or when the machine tells you to. You also have to wipe a little lint away from the door seal. No big deal.<br /><br />- No dryer vent, no woodland creatures nesting in dryer vent.<br /><br />- Lighted drum - I can see what I'm doing in there!<br /><br />- Uses less electricity than my old top-loader and traditional dryer, but provides better fabric care, MUCH less hassle, MUCH more convenience.<br /><br />- Takes up the space of one unit, not two.<br /><br />The cons:<br /><br />- Biggest con: I worry a bit that the machine will break down sometime, and because it's a rare-bird, there won't be repair parts in inventory in the US depots. Most top-loading machines are using the manufacturer's same 50-year-old design with different control electronics on top, and the parts supply-chain is well-established and well-stocked, besides coming from US manufacturers. I could go to Sears or the appliance parts store and walk out with a pump or motor for just about any US-made top-loader. Because this LG washer/dryer is a new thing, and there aren't millions in the US market, there aren't parts for millions of units in the supply chain, and you could run into problems if something broke down. So you might need to think about using a laundromat for a bit in that case. Didn't stop me from buying it, though.<br /><br />- Can't get linen/cotton shirts to look good - they come out a bit wrinkled. This is the only fabric I've had trouble with - everything else looks great. If you're doing tons of these, or are allergic to the clothes iron, this might not be the machine for you. But really, I've only got 3-4 shirts like this, and most of them had some permanent wrinkle in a stiffener before we got the machine. Wish they were easier, but really, I can get over it.<br /><br />- Not obvious how to set a dry-only cycle, and the manual doesn't help you figure this out. _IT DOES HAVE DRY-ONLY_ and it's really easy: Turn the machine on, touch the &#34;Dry&#34; button. It's different enough from setting a wash/dry cycle that you wouldn't think to do this. But it works, it's there, you can do dry-only. Might be counter-intuitive to get dry-only if you've got a wash-cycle selected. Might have to power the machine off, then on, then select Dry.<br /><br />- You only have one machine. It's plenty big (capacity-wise), but you can't have two loads working, one in a washer and one in a dryer simultaneously. Not a big deal for me, but thought I'd state it. Myself, I'd rather not handle wet clothes between. Really, it's a matter of your expectations, your flexibility, and your style of doing laundry chores.<br /><br />- Initial new smell. It did smell a bit for the first week or two (one negative reviewer said it smelled like machine oil. That might be about right). That went away, and it's fine now, didn't ruin any clothes in the process.<br /><br />- Wish the machine had a steam-only cycle. It doesn't. It will do steam as part of wash cycles, but you don't get to steam-and-tumble wrinkled dry clothes, for example. OK, throw a damp towel in with them or something.<br /><br />- Wish the drum lights would stay on longer. They stay on for 4 minutes, and I'd like 8, or at least the ability to turn 'em back on without powering the whole machine off-then-on while I'm unloading clothes.<br /><br />The wrap-up:<br /><br />I love this thing. I'll sometimes turn on the drum lights and watch it work for minutes at a time - it's like watching a reality TV show, but with more intelligent content.<br /><br />You'll probably want the 14&#34; pedestal to raise the machine up for easier drum access. I do. This isn't specific to this machine - most front-loaders could use one of these.<br /><br />We put ours in a catch-tray - a plastic tray that's designed to help keep any leaking malfunctions from ruining your floor. A proper catch tray has a drain line attached (ours doesn't - lack of planning ahead). We also were able to get a &#34;flat&#34; catch tray online, that slides under the machine before you raise the sides and close the corners. Hard to describe - but it works, and it fits the machine. Haven't had a leaking malfunction, just being cautious.<br /><br />Have I said I love it? Yeah. Really do. Great purchase, and the difference in power usage will probably pay off the extra cost over just a few years. (that's a guess, not a calculated figure. Looking forward to comparing year-over-year energy bills).<br /><br />UPDATE May, 2015 - Maybe the people who are saying &#34;OMG 5 HOURS TO DRY CLOTHES!!!&#34; are looking at the &#34;5:50&#34; that comes up when you initiate a dry-only cycle, then not checking to see how long the machine actually runs. Yes, I suppose it could take 5:50 to dry something, but actually, that's the LONGEST it could take from the selected cycle. It's an adaptive cycle which reduces time by sensing the humidity of the interior of the drum.<br /><br />You might be done in an hour. The &#34;5:50&#34; isn't a helpful guide to what will happen.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/1/2015: Had our first problem, first warranty service a couple weeks ago. The drum lights on the machine went out. In all other respects, the machine worked normally. Took a couple days for the LG field guy to get to us. He arrived, took about 2 minutes to look at the machine, realized the problem, but didn't have the parts to fix it. Said the parts are &#34;in the US, but they haven't been released yet&#34;, whatever that means.<br /><br />After a two week or so wait, the LG field guy got the parts, came out, installed in 20min. or so.<br /><br />The new lights are much brighter, and much whiter in color than the old ones, so I wonder if the first set was defective. I still am concerned that important parts might not be in stock when we need them; this repair provided a pain-free demonstration of that situation.<br /><br />The LG field guy was prompt, polite and competent, so that's a plus.<br /><br />My wife has done more washing lately, and says she can never get jeans right. My experience is different: don't over-dry them, and remove and fold pretty quick and you're good.<br /><br />Still love this machine. Works great for us.<br /><br />============ An update a little past 12 months in:<br /><br />After a little more than a year, the washer is still going great, and the love for it has not diminished here. Really great appliance.<br /><br />Recently, I read that several installations suffer from a drain pipe that's placed so high that the washer won't drain its water. That does seem like a design flaw in the machine (particularly if other washing machines work just fine in the same space), and it seems like it'd cause the problems with extremely poor drying that others are seeing. Myself, I've had no trouble with the draining, or drying, and the machine works just great.<br /><br />My wife got me the 14&#34; tall pedestal for the machine (which I'd guess can only help with the draining problem others have had) for my birthday, and it's really great to have the machine at a workable height. Don't know how I made it work without it now. For a post-installation install of pedestal, I recommend you get lifting straps (sold under many names; one that springs to mind is &#34;forearm forklift&#34;) and a strong friend to lift, and another friend to position the pedestal under the machine.<br /><br />One thing the machine does poorly, is handle envelopes. Boxes of them. I can't recommend that you wash a full box of 60 new #10 business envelopes in the machine (including the box), along with whatever you've had the couch covered in, though we _have_ tried it, entirely by accident. Quite a mess.<br /><br />I cleaned the machine's tub out the best I could, and paid special attention to all the nooks and crannies around the door gasket (lots of pulp in there), and I ran a tub-clean cycle, while I shook envelope bits and paper pulp off of the couch cover over the deck in back of the house.<br /><br />Soon enough, the machine showed an &#34;0E&#34; error (which I supposed might mean: &#34;0uch! Envelopes!&#34;) and I checked the manual: the machine can't drain water. I pulled the filter drain hose and tried to drain into a bucket, then pulled the filter, which turned into a little flood: recommend you have several buckets and a friend handy when handling this kind of problem. The filter was packed with grey paper pulp, which I cleaned out. I ran another empty cycle on tub clean (no 0E error this time), cleaned a few remnants of pulp from the filter and found more in the drum and on the door gasket. I chanced a load of laundry (grey to match the remaining pulp), and made it through fine.<br /><br />A number of loads later, the machine is still going strong, appears to have shaken off the envelope episode like a champ, and without a service call. Big props to it!<br /><br />UPDATE 5/14/2016 - data on the humidity question.<br /><br />I've been asked whether the machine makes the house more humid, and kind of fumbled for a response (generally, no, it doesn't). Here's a data point from an experiment:<br /><br />I borrowed a hygrometer (an Oasis musical instrument hygrometer, which helps musicians care for their wood instruments by measuring humidity and temperature and recording minimums and maximums - you can buy one on Amazon).<br /><br />After about five minutes of settling time in our kitchen (a good proxy for the rest of the house), no laundry run that day, humidity read 53%. I moved the unit into the laundry room/pantry (about 9.5' x 11', door open, also a freezer in the room) and let it settle there for a few minutes while I loaded the washer. Again, baseline at 53%. I set a four hour delay and ran the laundry (mid-size load of jeans) overnight. In the morning, the recorded max on the hygrometer was 57% humidity. By the time I came to look at it, the room had returned to 53%.<br /><br />I remain convinced that people who are having disastrous humidity or wet clothes problems are suffering from the reported installation issue where the drain pipe is too tall for the machine to effectively drain water. Yes, I think that's a design flaw in the machine, but one that can be worked around at installation time, if the installer knows about it.<br /><br />Only one data point, but some data is better than none. Hope this helps!<br /><br />UPDATE: Over 2 years in, still love the machine.<br /><br />We were out of town for a few days, and the display said &#34;CL&#34; and the machine wouldn't take any input at all. I was very worried. This symptom didn't show up in the manual. I looked it up on line.<br /><br />&#34;Child Lock&#34;. The door was locked and it's not supposed to take any input in this state. Easy enough for a grown-up to turn off. What I imagine happened is that there was a power-cut while we were gone, and Child Lock comes on as some kind of safety feature or something.<br /><br />Everything's fine - machine's still running great!<br /><br />----<br />Update 11/19/2018, about 3-1/2 years of ownership: Just a little trouble...<br /><br />The machine was starting to dry clothes poorly. We began having to run an extra dry cycle. It'd been falling off for a while now, and I decided, since it was out of warranty, and I'm pretty handy, to get inside and have a look. I suspected a lint clog in the air system (thanks to one of my much earlier respondents below, who suggested cleaning this out annually - I had not done so).<br /><br />I made CERTAIN that the machine was STONE-COLD (there's a heating element in there that could've messed me up, even when unplugged, if it was still hot), and UNPLUGGED from power before I started.<br /><br />The lid came off the machine pretty easily - two screws at the back, I slid the lid backward and off.<br /><br />You can see the heating element and blower motor in the first top-off picture. They have their covers on. I carefully took off the covers, unplugging the blower motor by pinching the sides of the connector, and carefully cleaned the air circuit with a long flexible brush (called a refrigerator coil brush - got mine at an appliance parts shop years ago - I'd bet Amazon has them for sale, too).<br /><br />In the second top-off picture, you can see in the flashlight beam, the inside of the top of a tube that heads down to the bottom. Since I was going to clean out this tube, I had to take the back door off the washer and temporarily remove a black rubber boot from the bottom of the tube, so I wouldn't just cram the tube with lint. I got about a Tupperware salad bowl full of wet lint out of the tube, and reassembled the boot.<br /><br />At the top of the tube, you can see in the third top-off picture, there's a shiny silver sensor that my clean-out has uncovered, sticking into the tube. I believe that the trouble with drying was because this sensor was completely covered in lint. I vacuumed out the rest of the lint I could easily get, and reassembled everything, and ran a Tub Clean to get rid of any lint I'd knocked into the works.<br /><br />After the tub-clean, we ran a regular load of laundry on my regular setting, and MAGIC! Wonderfully dry clothes once more.<br /><br />This maintenance took me a couple hours - and would've taken less if I'd just made it a point to do so annually. The machine needed no parts, and I didn't need a service tech to fix it (N.B. - would've certainly called a tech if it was still under warranty - the \"10 Year\" warranty is on the direct-drive tub motor). I used a screwdriver (OK, and an electric driver for removing the screws pretty quick), a brush and a flashlight.<br /><br />The machine is back to its peak performance, and I'm still quite happy with it. Wish I hadn't had to maintain, but the maintenance was cake, and the thing still runs like a top, cleans great, and is, as you've seen if you've read the above review, a great fit for me. I'd certainly buy another if I needed to.<br /><br />------<br />February 2020 about 4-3/4 years in:<br />Machine still going strong with no further service since the big vent clean out (except regular monthly lint filter clean).<br /><br />Tried something new tonight: I washed a soft guitar case.<br /><br />I accidentally bought a guitar from a smoking owner without checking the stink out first. Oops. Smells like an ashtray. I thought about risking the cost of a new case before I decided to wash the provided soft case in the LG. (I could've destroyed the case in the wash, and won't promise you that you won't destroy your case or washer. You try it at your own risk).<br /><br />Worked great: I washed it alone, no dry cycle (air drying it in the house for a few days). The machine fumbled with the case off balance, and didn't do a great spin, but it came out clean and intact, not stinking of smoke. It'll be fine. Cleaned up the guitar while the wash ran.<br /><br />Still love this machine.\n",

      "Review 12780:\n",
      "Text: I found an awesome video that is Fagor's own DVD that someone uploaded on You Tube that shows the basic how to instructions for this exact Fagor washer/dryer combo machine FAS3612 and FAS3612X. (X- is the same exact model in stainless.)This DVD does not come with your new washer but you will want to have this video to watch when you are first learning to use this washer. The washer is complicated until you know the machine then it is easy. The manual is not completely clear. I did not have this video when I first tried out the machine. (Oh how I wish I had found this video first.)<br />[...]<br />This little 7 minute video will save you HOURS of trial and error trying figure out how to use the dryer component. It is so simple but not clearly explained in the manual.<br /><br />I just got my washer but I have only been able to use my washer for 2 days because of issues which I will go into later after the dust has settled. I have washed approximately 10 loads including a queen size quilt, a double bedspread, and a twin blanket. I love that I can wash blankets and comforters in this machine and they are coming out very nice and clean. I could not do that in my old machine. I have not dried 10 loads (thankfully I have the backup of my old Maytag dryer. which is on a stacking wrack over my new Fagor machine. While I am catching up on lots of laundry and learning HOW the dryer function is going to work best for me. I could NOT have done 10 loads in such a short time period 2- days if I was using the drier component of the washer 100 percent. (maybe once i understand it but not yet) I am doing trial and error trying to figure out how long it takes to dry various loads so having the back up of a dryer has been wonderful. I call it the best of both worlds.<br /><br />Now that my new Fagor washer dryer combo is up and running-- I must say that I am very impressed. I have been using the laundry mat and a friend's fancy Fisher Paykel washer for 3-4 months after my 30 year old Maytag finally bit the dust. I loved my Maytag. It was the top of the line in it's day and it gave me very little problems so I used it until it was pronounced dead and I was very sad to say goodbye. The Fisher Paykel machine that my friend owns, I had helped to research and pick out-- and it was the nicest washer that I had ever used (I admit that I was slightly jealous.) I the Fisher Paykel is a slow washer and that drove me nuts since I was in someone else's house waiting for a load to finish for what seemed like forever, but it got the clothes very bright and clean and I understand that slow is the new modern way of washers and I was going to have to accept that. (Thank goodness, I had a taste of slow washing already because yes this Fagor machine is slow.) Using mostly the old laundry mat for 3 months as I did, my clothes were getting extremely dingy. Stains were NOT coming out and then every now and then I would use the Fisher Paykel machine at my friend's house and my clothes would be noticeably much cleaner with one wash but it could only do so much even with bleach.<br /><br />My first load in the Fagor Washer Dryer Combo was with bated breath, I had spent so much $$ on this machine and I had waited so long for it to arrive. I had run into issues with the wrong hoses being shipped, not fitting, and water squirting everywhere (I will explain that more later) so my first wash load (It took forever to figure out the little manual) I had to go back on line and read what the others here had typed about using the dryer program and it took me a few loads to get the dryer mostly figured out. So when the first load washed on PROGRAM-4 (Which is normal wash- warm- 104 degrees)came out of the washer, the clothes were steaming hot, wet, and they were SO CLEAN. WOW, Oh my gosh, stains were mostly all gone (without using bleach) I have a pair of off white cotton pants that I have worn in the garden and muck all summer which had ground in dirt stains. I had gotten them as clean as I thought was humanly possible with several bleach washings.  Oh my word, the Fagor got most of the stains out (they have only a few light spots left),I bet that those stains WILL come out with a more intense wash program on this machine.<br /><br />I spent a long time trying to figure out the manual, face it, it is written in English but for people who are used to these type of machines. There are missing pieces of key information for Americans-- thank goodness for this sight where we can share our experiences. And the above video.<br /><br />Someone mentioned (I don't know if it was at this site or another site) that their clothes don't shrink. (I think that they must be using the gentle dry cycle. I have not tested that Program for shrinkage yet.) I tested the Normal Hot Program with a pair of Jeans that were a size too big and had been dryed on HOT in 5 different gas and electric dryers since I bought them (I could not shrink them). I was trying to shrink them all summer. Well one trip through the FAGOR Normal Hot Dryer Program, (@170 degrees per a phone call to Fagor Tech support.) I got the clothes bone dry and shrunk those pants in legnth and girth. Maybe I over dried them I am not used to this machine yet and it is hard to guess how long to set the machine to dry. I did something like this with the load that had the jeans (Drier time-- 20 minutes, walk away come back 2 hours later, no not dry yet still very wet, 30 more minutes walk away for 2 hours, no not dry yet, hmm I will try 70 minutes this time or I will never get this load finished.)<br /><br />Something that you CANNOT do with this dryer is dry a little then open the door and pull something out or add another item. I like to dry that way. This machine LOCKS and will not open the door until the inside has cooled to a certain degree before you can open the door. Hence the walking away and forgetting to come back and check on the dryer again for hours. It would be much easier if you could open the door and test for dryness. I guess 170 degrees probably would scald you checking the laundry. But you waste all that heat inside the drum waiting for the load to cool off to pull something out or add something. I will have to learn how long through trial and error that it takes to dry different weights of fabric. Sheets vs towels for example then set the dryer accordingly to pull things out at the point I want to hang them up.<br /><br />There is a Delicate Dry Program which I will try next to determine shrinkage. That may be the way to go with clothes. I don't know how hot the Delicate Dry Program gets that is not in the manual. It is recommended for synthetics. (And these jeans do have a stretch to the material so they probably should have been on the delicate heat because of the strech fabric) I am happy to have shrunk them- but be warned!<br /><br />I have learned that it is well worth adding the extra 10 minutes to have a gentler spin using the Anti Crease Option. Otherwise the clothes are seriously wrinkled and the wrinkles don't hang out when the clothes are hung up wet. Even sheets I will use that Anti Crease option every time from now on. There is also a NO SPIN option for very delicate fabrics and clothes. I have not tested that one.<br /><br />Prior to buying this machine I had asked everyone if they use H.E soap and or bleach and everyone told me NO to both. I asked my trusted repairman and he told me that Bleach wears out the rubber gaskets and things deep in the inner workings of the machines. (He is not familiar with Fagor yet but we did get him signed up to be THE Fagor Repair Specialist because there were none in my state.) He told me use bleach only very sparingly and remember that I need a lot less bleach than with a traditional washer because there is so much less water. He recommends not ever using bleach. Because there is a thin peice of metal (generic washer information) that is part of the spider mechanism that bleach eats. I am using H.E. soap I bought the little measured packs that you toss in the washer with the load of clothes. I am very pleased with H.E. soap (I bought these packets for the laundry mat and it helped get the clothes the cleanest possible in those crappy machines. My repairman told me also that he sees the non H.E. soaps are hard on the inner parts of the front loaders and actually causes them to wear out faster. The dirt floats on top of the old fashioned detergents and therefore float the dirt and soap debri up into areas where it can do damage when it is left behind. He said that the enzymes in those soaps continue to eat at the bearings and that thin piece of metal in the spider of these machines. Amounting to expensive repairs. He recommended using only H.E. soaps in all the front loaders. The Fagor mamual does not mention pros or cons of H.E soap. The repairman told me that also vinegar, and borax are perfectly fine to use in top loader machines-- in general they should do no harm. The same with bleach substitutes.<br /><br />I really like that this machine is very quiet and smooth. It rather purrs like a little cat. This is the quietest washing machine I have ever used. I have it located it my bathroom which is just off my bedroom and in the center of my house. Normally I do not feel the vibration of the machine. But when it is unbalanced then the vibrations increase increase increase. I was sitting on my bed talking on the phone when the load went unbalanced. The machine is new so I didn't know what was happening. (User error I am sure) I laughed so hard as my bed began to vibrate,more and more and more, remember motels with the 25 cent bed vibrators? It was just like that. We used to love those when we were kids. Anyway that is not the regular experience with this washer. And while it was loud it wasn't obnoxiously loud. In fact the old washer made more noise every time I ran it. But I never had a mechanical vibrating bed outside of a cheap motel before. It was hysterical.<br /><br />I will keep coming back to add to this as I am learning more about this machine.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have had my fagor machine for 3-1/2 months. I have done a lot of washing of quilts and dog and cat bedding. I inherited a dog that sheds every minute of the day. So dog hair is on everything. AHHHH! This washing machine has been doing a really good job of getting the hair out of the laundry. I shake it outside before washing and in the past had to wipe down the inside of old washer after washing something hairy and wipe down the inside of the dryer after the same article. I keep all the hairy dog items together for one load. I still shake and keep the dogs items seperated from mine but this dog also gets all of my clothes hairy. So this is a problem for me, I hate hairy clothing! Good news is this washer does a really good job of grabbing the hair into the lint trap. After cleaning a hairy load of laundry the front rubber gasket and the holes where the lint is taken away is all that I have to wipe up with a little rag or thin washcloth, or even a napkin. The inside of the washer typically is NOT hairy after a hairy load. Except if your lint cup is full. Then the washer can't really grab the lint or hair and it gets deposited back on to the clothes.<br /><br />The lint cup: That is my nemesis! I do not like emptying it because there is such a tiny clearance between the machine and the floor that it is impossible to get a towel back under the machine very far. I had emptied it after one week, that was too soon to be of any use a tiny bit of lint was in the cup and it was not worth the cup or two of water that pours out onto the floor so fast that none of my towels are able to absorb it before it is everywhere. (I don't have a sealed floor) I tried it again at the one month point. Still not enough lint to warrant the work and the water mess -- there was just a tiny ball of lint the size of dime and some hair. So I let it go probably about 2 months maybe a little more this time. I had a load with no lint of it's own get covered with lint from the previous load (new wash cloths) and was noticing that it SEEMED like suddenly clothes had more hair on them when they came out than when they went in.<br /><br />Hmmm, it's been a long while since I cleaned out that lint cup...<br /><br />This time I found a piece of hard wood that was left over from an old antique table that was 1-inch high, by 2-inches wide, by 30\" long, I shoved that under the left side of the machine. I was able to tip the machine up and push this under with my foot. That gave me clearance to bunch up a towel under and around the machine to catch the gush of water. This maneuver will need tweaking as there still was too much water for my towel but this was the least mess so far. And the lint cup-- it was packed full of dog hair. The wooden piece from the antique table has a new permanent use to lift the corner of the machine. Now I will hunt for the right size shallow pan to catch the water to shove under the hatch opening for next time.<br /><br />Update it has been about 2 years. I don't like this machine. I can't get the lint out of it I have no idea where it is hiding. I clean and clean the machine and then it deposits lint all over my clothes. I am the laundry queen and I have never had such beat up linty clothes in 30 years of doing wash. At first the machine was not doing this (I wasn't drying much in the beginning but now whether I dry or not this machine seems to beat up my clothes.) I do small loads, increasingly more and more on gentle (which isn't helping much) and I am a careful sorter. Linty things together. So I bought an entire load of sweat pants since I didn't want to wash them with anything else. 4 pairs of black sweat pants. It takes 4 loads of wash to get the black lint out of the machine. And all the black sweats look 90 years old because light colored lint got deposited onto them. The lint seems to become perment balls on the fabric. I am not happy about this. I have a lot of expensive worn out looking clothes that have only been washed on cold and gentle cycle and hung up to dry.<br /><br />It takes forever to dry a load of towels and that is 2 towels, 8 wash cloths 4 dish sponges probably only about 5-7 pounds of laundry. I don't know how you would ever get 13 lbs of dry laundry into this machine. Drying one towel and some washcloths takes hours drying two towels plus smaller stuff I have done 3 or more hours.<br /><br />I loved this machine at first (I chalked any disappointments to a learning curve, that would work itself out and get better) but after almost 2 years I am very disappointed. Cleaning the lint cup takes planning... what I am going to use this time that will be better than last time to divert the water so it doesn't run behind the washer where there is no way to get a towel? After 2 years you'd think I would be a pro at it. NO I still am not!  Tonight was the cleanest ever but I had to use a rug and a bath towel which were both clean and now need to be washed. It is practically an act of God to clean out the lint cup. (I have found myself wasting mental energy re-designing the stupid thing). I finally figured out that I could take the little drop down plastic door off, with it out of the way the job is much easier-- but still not easy. I have less spilled water now with the door out of the way.  Tonight I actually measured the amount of water that came out of the machine during the process, (because I caught most of it this time rather than spilling half of it. There was 4 cups of watered captured. (horrible design) I decided to leave the little plastic door off permanently so that it won't get broken before I decide to move. I will pop it back on and sell this machine with the house.\n",

      "Review 1014660:\n",
      "Text: Some more notes, after using this for 2 years and 7 months:<br /><br />My original washer axle wore out (the metal rod wore all the way through!) after almost 2 1/2 years' of use, so I bought an &#34;open box&#34; replacement at half the full retail price. If I recall correctly, the unit arrived in two days (via FedEx; I didn't pay extra for fast delivery).<br /><br />This unit is holding up great and performs better than the first one, which leaked a bit around the lid. This one has virtually no leaking at all, and the axle seems to be better lubricated and insulated from water intrusion than the original one, which started to bleed its graphite lubricant after awhile. I've been using the replacement for only about a month, so maybe it's simply too soon for that minor problem to develop, but it hasn't yet.<br /><br />I use these units for about 500 washes/year, so if I have to replace them every 2 1/2 years, that's unfortunate but still works out to only 4 cents per micro-load of laundry. While I hope the manufacturer continues to improve their design and construction (I'd eliminate the fussy draining mechanism at the barrel bottom entirely, or at least offer customers a choice, with two different models; I also wish the frame/base/struts parts were sturdier -- but anyone can strengthen their WonderWash by wrapping the base/frame in duct tape or similar), the unit is still a terrific item for people who don't have laundry machines at home, hate going to laundromats, and or wish to live off-the-grid or with a lower carbon footprint.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />**************<br /><br />Adding a few notes to my very long review (included below) from 2016:<br /><br />My happiest discovery is, for those using this device in their shower stall or tub, to get a full-sized (~12.5&#34; x 19&#34;) milk crate and prop the WonderWash on top of it. Put the crate so that its length crosses the width of the tub (I can do this with about 2&#34; clearance); the curvature of the tub cradles the milk crate and keeps it from moving forwards and back as you crank the handle forwards and back. Using a milk crate as a pedestal saves me from having to stoop forward and downwards; now I can crank the handle while -- admittedly -- kneeling, but in a back-friendly erect posture. Elevating the WW also makes it easier to pull the heavy, sopping-wet clothes out of the unit. This makes for a HUGE difference in comfort and exertion, with no more backaches!<br /><br />I also use a bit more water at a time than what I originally recommended -- as much as 3/4 full. But to do this safely, you'll need to reinforce your WW's flimsy plastic frame first (I wrapped mine in duct tape -- and after 20 months, it's holding up fine).<br /><br />How much detergent to use?  Roughly a palm's worth, to which I add another palm's worth of detergent-boosting washing soda. I've experimented plenty with both &#34;20 Mule Team Borax&#34; and Arm and Hammer Washing Soda&#34;, and I much prefer the latter (I think the laundry dries smelling fresher), but YMMV. If you prefer the Borax, stick with that.<br /><br />I will use the same load of wash water for up to FOUR TIMES -- when the clothes aren't too dirty or dye-shedding. (To do this, you'll obviously want to progress from whites to darks.) I do add some hot water, detergent and washing soda as I go along, to maintain the original water level and soapiness. This saves time and money, but I make sure that every item gets a generous, clean, warm rinse -- and many items, like terrycloth towels and other cotton items -- get rinsed twice. But I don't have to give each rinsing the full treatment (45 spins in the WW) -- just some plunging and squeezing in a bucket to get the bulk of the soap out for the first rinse is fine. I do spin everything after each rinse in the Nina spin dryer, although for items due a second, proper rinse, their first spin will be less complete and a lot shorter than that final, drying spin cycle.<br /><br />To save some more time, money, and effort, when removing laundry from the WW, dump it straight into a large colander on top of a cheap plastic bowl or tub of a similar size. Pressing is a lot quicker and easier (if less thorough) than squeezing the water out while holding the sopping-wet items over the open mouth of the WW. You can dump the drained water right back into the WW to re-use it on the next load.<br /><br />I absolutely wash my terrycloth bath towels in the WonderWash -- but this has become much easier since replacing my old ones with new, lightweight, energy-efficient/quick-drying towels. The only difference between the old-fashioned and new- towels seems to be that in the old ones, the loops were attached to a thick backing layer. The new towels manage to hold together despite being almost all-loops, with minimal backing. The loops themselves are just as big and fluffy! (I found good quick-drying towels at Target, for $4 each -- but that's hardly the only store where you can find that category of towel in that price range.) Anyway, these towels spin-dry much dryer than my old ones, and air-dry much faster.<br /><br />For Nina spin-dryer users, it's probably a good idea when ending a spin to crack that lid open, then let it expend most of its energy coasting while it gently slows down of its own accord, without forcing a more abrupt stop until after it spins out for a good 20-30 seconds. To do this without having to hover over the unit holding the lid just so, find something cheap and unbreakable with some weight to it and a slide-resistant bottom that ideally fits into the wide, shallow groove on the lid, and rest that object on the lid. (I use a small vinyl-clad wire basket that I use in the bathroom as a storage catch-all.) To prevent it from slipping down and off of the dryer lid, I affixed two clear, self-stick silicone bumpers onto the lid.<br /><br />Most Nina dryer users have probably figured this out already, but just because the WW limits the size of a wash load to, roughly, two pairs of lightweight pants and a couple of T-shirts, doesn't mean that we can't consolidate these tiny loads in the dryer. I frequently combine clothes from more than one washing load's worth in the spinner, saving quite a bit of time.<br /><br />As for hanging clothes up to dry, if you don't have the room for a large clothes rack, get a collapsible one. And/or, if your place has dormer windows, you can screw in closet-rod holders on the walls in those narrow nooks and saw 1/2&#34; wooden dowels to fit (I found both of these items at Home Depot, but any hardware store will probably have them) and you've got a quick fix. And when you're done, you can remove the dowel rods and stash them out of sight somewhere.<br /><br />From April 19, 2016:<br /><br />I bought this along with Laundry Alternative's &#34;Nina&#34; spin dryer (110V size -- the one with the pink feet) in early December, so I've had them for four months now, and I'll never go back to laundromats.<br /><br />I've got a few tips for using this unit:<br />1)  Before you wash your first load, wrap the frame's vertical parts with at least two layers of duct tape. (I also wrapped the bottom corners for extra strength.) It bucks and heaves a bit when half full of water, and I can't imagine it holding up well over time without the extra reinforcement.<br /><br />2)  You're going to need to use this model (with the pop top) in a bathtub or similar, because it leaks quite a bit around the lid while in use -- anything from a few drops to a heavy spurt, on each rotation. What's more, because of the spinning, quite a bit of this will be landing on you, so you may want to block most of it with an upraised hand (the suction cups can keep it pretty firmly stuck to the tub, so you can generally turn it with one hand without needing to hold the frame still), and/or wear an old T-shirt or bib or something. Definitely not any shirt you want to wear immediately after outside the house! (Side note:  I use my Wonder Wash in the bathtub, which necessitates kneeling on the floor and/or squatting for a couple of minutes at a time. You'll want a nice, thick, spongy bathmat or similar for your knees, and all the kneeling/squatting and leaning and bending over -- as in pulling out the wet, heavy clothes and squeezing out the excess back into the barrel -- may be too arduous for persons with bad knees or backs.<br /><br />3)  Remove the plastic plug-thingy from inside the tub and toss it -- along with the draining tube -- in the trash. The plug catches on clothes and comes loose with some frequency, making a loud rattling sound as the tub is turned. Don't worry, the bottom is reliably watertight without it. (I think its purpose is to keep the clothes from clogging the drain while emptying via the tube.) The Wonder Wash leaks way too much to use it anywhere but in the bathtub, shower or outdoors. I was hoping to use mine on the kitchen counter top next to the sink, or on a wheeled kitchen pantry cart that I could wheel next to the sink, but those are out of the question. The upside of this is, since I'm stuck with using it in my bathtub, I can drain the Wonder Wash by flipping the barrel upside-down. This is 10X faster than waiting for it to drain slowly through that tube, with the clothes obstructing the flow (even with the plug left in...).<br /><br />4)  I also recommend getting several cheap plastic salad-type bowls, the kind of thing you can get for $1-to-$3 at discount stores, for holding your mini-loads of laundry in its stages of washed, wrung or spun but needing a rinse, etc. I use my Wonder Wash along with the Nina spin-dryer, but I'll do about three loads of laundry using the same wash water, depending on how well it's holding up, of course. You'll also need a narrower, taller one to catch the water from the Nina spin dryer, if you're using one.<br /><br />5)  You'll get your clothes cleaner and use less detergent if you boost your loads with a small amount of washing soda (not washing powder, but soda, like this:  [...]). This is especially so if you're laundering white items, stained items, or washing in hard (mineralized) water. The washing soda assists in stain-busting directly, but it also binds with the minerals in the water, which helps the (tiny quantity of) detergent do its thing.<br /><br />6)  I've only used hot water so far, and I'm not tempted to try otherwise. I spin-wash most of my items 120 times (about two minutes), and the combination of hot water and washing soda is removing the long-term stains in my white cotton athletic socks and the armpit stains in a couple of ancient white t-shirts. So yes, if you use this unit as specified (plus a little soda), you can get your clothes cleaner than many laundromat machines ever get them!<br /><br />7)  Fill it to no more than the halfway line with water, and try for a 50-50 ratio of water to clothes. The fragility of the frame makes it important to not go much beyond that line, and the clothes need space to slosh and roll around in order to get thoroughly clean, anyway.<br /><br />8)  The Wonder Wash uses a graphite lubricant around the axle/shaft and sheds black flecks of it, which runs down the sides of the barrel and onto one's base surface (another great reason to use this in the bathtub or shower stall!). While I don't think this lubricant stains clothes, you'll have to take care to not let washed clothes flop down and into it as you squeeze them dry. Four months on, and my unit is still shedding specks of graphite (or whatever it is).<br /><br />9)  There's a fair amount of lint in the dirty wash water, and if you simply pour this down the drain, it'll eventually clog it up. So far I've been using two wire-mesh drain protectors, but I'm going to try pouring the dirty water into a cheap (thank you, dollar-store!) colander with the filter from a new HVAC HEPA air filter instead. That ought to do it!<br /><br />***************<br />General impressions:<br /><br />Reservations about the frame's strength and the leaky lid aside, it's a great unit to have for anyone looking for an alternative to laundromats, doing laundry by hand in the kitchen sink (which is more time-consuming than this, yields variable results, and is hard on one's hands) or energy-intensive washing machines in general, out of principle. Yes, you'll save money, you'll be lowering your personal carbon footprint, and this device treats your clothes with more TLC than many regular washing machines, but the single greatest benefit is not having to choose between going to the laundromat every two weeks or having dirty laundry piling up. Now I always have what I want to wear ready to wear, and with very little piling up of dirty laundry. Granted, now I have damp laundry hung up or laid out on racks in my apartment two or three times a week, but that's an improvement over the full hampers and even bags of dirties on the floor which I used to have.<br /><br />Having both the Wonder Wash and the Nina spinner makes it possible to home-wash sweaters as frequently as they need them, knowing that they won't get torn up by a harsh clothes washer mechanism, shrink in a heat dryer, or sit out for a solid two days drying at home (they dry in one day or less now -- much, much better!)<br /><br />I also find this combo especially valuable in washing bras (tip:  hook them before washing, to keep them from catching on things) and the wool-blend socks I wear in the northern-US winter... no more tearing up lingerie bags in laundromat machines, losing socks in washers, or inadvertently shrinking those socks if they stay in heat dryers too long!<br /><br />As for capacity, I'm able to wash and spin-dry my fuzzy (polyester fleece), full-length bathrobe. For sure, it fills both the washer and the dryer, but both (barely) manage to handle it. And being polyester, the bathrobe is completely dry in a couple of hours or so, even in my cold apartment in the winter. Terrycloth bath towels are no problem -- just do them one at a time. Some people have posted that they can't do sheets in this unit, but I find it's no problem doing sheets one at a time -- but mine are only &#34;Full&#34;-sized. To dry, I drape the sheets (one at a time) on a wheeled clothes rod/rack, over plastic clothes hangers to spread the two halves apart for faster drying. Works like a charm.<br /><br />Then there's considerations of quality and comfort:  busting old stains with the aid of the washing soda (which I only started using with the Wonder Wash, fearful it needed it.) Not wearing out my fingertips doing laundry in the sink, or wearing out my hands and clothes by harsh hand-wringing. (I squeeze the excess water out before spin-drying them.) Granted, hang-dried laundry is unsightly and somewhat inconvenient, and some fabrics tend to dry stiff or wrinkled. Bath towels are quite stiff after drying, but they soften up again with the first use.<br /><br />Not to overlook the environmental & economic considerations:  no more trips to the laundromat. Using much less detergent. Using minimal energy to dry clothes, although you may need to set a portable heater near them in the winter, if you keep your place as cold as I do. (On a related note, drying clothes at home during the winter humidifies the air quite nicely, although the extra condensation on windows can lead to mildew under them if you're not careful...) No more lost socks or heat-shrunk wool items. Less wear-and-tear generally, esp. if you spin-dry the clothes prior to hanging them up to dry.<br /><br />The one thing this unit (along with the Nina spin-dryer) won't save you is time, if you are accustomed to doing huge batches of laundry all at once at a laundromat. This product washes mini (or micro-) batches of laundry, and you'll still have to squeeze & wring them dry, or spin them and then hang them up or lay them out on drying racks. And it won't be long before you run out of handy doorways, shower rods, and other places around the apartment to hang up damp/wet clothes. On the other hand, it beats going to the 'mat every week, if that's your pattern.<br /><br />And a final outcome of my new laundry system:  I used to keep a lot of clothes around as fallback items to wear after using my favorites. I dreaded laundromat sessions so much, I'd put them off and the dirty laundry would pile up to a ridiculous, unseemly extent. This week, I culled one closet of least-favorite shirts, since I don't need to keep them around anymore. I've got two more closets to cull, and then I'll be donating this stuff to charity.\n",

      "Text: Update! (My original review is below)<br />After using this washer for several months now, I wanted to update my review. I use this little thing almost daily, and it is still working like a champ! It was absolutely worth every penny. The only issues I've had have been 100% operator errors. If you pay attention to the size of load that you try to wash, and if you don't try to make this machine do more than it was designed to do, it should work great and last a good long while.<br /><br />The one \"major problem\" I had turned out to be total user error. I squashed way too much into the spin side, and a sock fell out of the spinner into the cabinet under it. That is where water drains to before it goes into the drain hose. The sock blocked the opening to the drain hose, but I thought the whole machine had just stopped draining. Nope. Once I realized what had happened, I was able to nudge the spinner over just enough to reach down inside the cabinet and get the sock. Then it worked perfectly again.<br /><br />I am currently washing probably my millionth load in this washing machine, and it works exactly as it did when I first got it. Without a full size washing machine, this little gem has been a total life saver.<br /><br />Big take-aways: Keep in mind that this is a COMPACT washer. It was not designed to wash full-size load. Not even close. It is only able to handle VERY small loads, and you may have to experiment with that to know exactly how much it can wash at one time. Your idea of \"small\" and the machine's idea of \"small\" might be very different. It will wash small loads very well if you don't over-fill it.<br /><br />It can handle AT MOST about two pairs of adult jeans OR two big bath towels OR a few T shirts OR a couple of hoodies. After filling the wash side, watch it as it agitates. If the clothes don't move around freely in the water, you have over-loaded it. Take some of the clothes out and try again. Also, the spin side won't necessarily handle everything that the wash side will. When I wash two pairs of jeans, I always have to spin them separately, one at a time.<br /><br />______________________________________<br /><br />(Tips at the bottom of this review)<br />MY INITIAL EXPERIENCE:<br /><br />First, be easy on this machine. It is not a typical residential washer. Just because you can stuff the wash tub and spin tub to capacity doesn’t mean that won’t break the machine. This takes some patience and some getting used to. If you overload it, it’s going to break. If the clothes don’t move and agitate freely in the wash tub, it’s overloaded. If the spin tub knocks, it’s off balance. Any washer does this when a load is off balance.<br /><br />CHECK YOUR MACHINE before you use it just to be sure the wash tub and spin tub are clean inside. I believe my machine was either a return from another buyer, or else it had dampness inside the wash tub for some other reason. There was a LOT of mildew inside the wash tub around the top when I unboxed it. If I wasn't so big on inspecting things, I would not have seen it until probably much later, and I would have assumed it was from dampness after my own use.<br /><br />I cleaned off the mildew using a disinfectant cleaner and a sponge, and it came off completely. I was OK with that, even though I remain a bit annoyed at having to clean up a mess before I could use what I had assumed that I bought new. I don't know for a fact that my machine was a return. All I know is that there was mildew inside. It could theoretically have come from being stored in a humid environment, I suppose.<br /><br />WHAT TO EXPECT FROM ITS PERFORMANCE:<br /><br />This is a LIGHT-duty washing machine, and it works perfectly fine for what it is. Although it says that it dries, what they really mean is that it spins. This is NOT a washer dryer combination machine, but I knew that when I bought it. It spins shockingly well. Clothes come out very much like they do with a full size machine. I'm super happy about that. Wringing out wet clothes sucks, and I don't have to do that. Because I am a fusser, I did lift the lid while it was spinning. I was happy to learn that the spin cycle shuts off if you lift the lid. If it's unbalanced, you can lift the lid and adjust the clothes.<br /><br />This machine does spin, but not in the wash tub. When you drain the wash tub you will need gravity. The spin tub is separate -- the washing side of the machine where most of the water is does not spin.<br /><br />If you put the machine inside a bathtub, you'll want to elevate it with something. That will keep water from running under the machine and risking electric shock or ruining the machine. I set mine on a platform beside the bathtub and dropped the drain hose over into the tub. It works fine that way.<br /><br />If you have ordinary loads, this machine will handle them. If you wash a lot of jeans and sweatshirts, plan to spend a lot of time babysitting your laundry. You'll have to do them in multiple VERY small loads (one or two pieces per load) or else you'll burn up the motor and your clothes will not come clean because the machine won't be able to agitate them. Even if the amount of clothes will fit, the machine won't clean them if you add several heavy pieces. I'm looking at you, Levis and hoodies.<br /><br />My first load was several small pieces. It washed totally fine. I washed several pairs of socks, several pairs of underwear, three basic T shirts, one short nightgown, and a couple of small hand towels together. The machine handled this load with ease.<br /><br />On my second load, I washed two pairs of size 12 (American) women's Levis, and that is all. The machine did not like this load one little bit. It struggled HARD to agitate them. I added more water than I should have just to free up the clothes a bit and take some of the burden off of the motor, and I watched the machine like a hawk the whole time. I will wash jeans one-at-a-time from here on out. The spin cycle was fine spinning out one pair of jeans at a time.<br /><br />This machine will not handle adult blankets and other similar heavy things. The wash cycle won't agitate them, and you'll burn up the motor trying. It should work fine for a basic set of full size sheets. I'll be finding out later today. :)<br /><br />Spinning the clothes is interesting. If you wash what this machine considers a full load, which is much smaller than a full load in a big machine, you can wash them all together. But when you spin them, you'll need to spin a few pieces at a time. I broke up my first load into three groups. The spin tub is about half the size of the wash tub.<br /><br />HOW TO USE IT:<br /><br />The instruction booklet will give you the most basic of basic information, but it will not really tell you how to use the machine. You will want to watch some review videos (videos are priceless, trust me) and read reviews if you really want to know how to make it work in the real world. I would have made a video, but my bathroom is too small. I watched several videos before I used it the first time, so I had a basic understanding of the machine. This is definitely a participation-required kind of laundry experience. But that works for me because I've always been fussy about washing clothes anyway.<br /><br />This machine is a twin tub. It has one tub for washing, and a separate tub for spinning. The instructions do not really explain exactly how to do this. I developed my own method.<br /><br />First, I fill the wash tub using the fill hose (it worked for me), and add detergent. I only used about 1/4 of the amount of detergent that I'd use in a big machine. I fill the tub to the \"H\" level marked inside the tub and add my clothes. Close the lid, turn the \"Select Switch\" dial (the one that says Soft, Standard, and Drain). Soft is for a gentle wash. Then turn the \"Wash Timer\" dial for anywhere from a 1 to 15 minute wash. The instructions tell you to turn on the machine before you begin. There is no power switch. Trust me, I looked. Turning the Wash Timer dial starts the machine. Only turn the dial clockwise, and don't try to force the timer back or ahead once it has started.<br /><br />The machine will NOT automatically drain when the cycle ends. The cycle will stop, then you'll need to manually turn the \"Select Switch\" to the Drain settling. Water will come pouring out of the drain hose. I have my machine sitting on a platform beside the bathtub so gravity helps the water drain out.<br /><br />After those steps are done, move some of the clothes over into the spin tub. Put the little plastic cover over the clothes and press down on it a little. The cover is the loose plastic piece with perforations through it. Then close the machine lid. Switch the \"Spin Timer\" dial to however many minutes you like. I tend to go for the five minute spin.<br /><br />After you've spun out all of the clothes in that load, move everything back over to the wash tub and repeat the steps for washing, except this time you're rinsing. This is where you can add fabric softener, if you like. Then repeat the steps for spinning like before.<br /><br />ABOUT USING THE FILL HOSE:<br /><br />I have seen many, many reviews showing that the fill hose won't fit any faucet. I must have lucked out. I unscrewed the aerator at the end of my bathroom sink faucet and removed it, and the end of the fill hose fit over it perfectly fine. No leaks whatsoever. My sink faucet is a high arc style and it's narrow. Your mileage will probably vary. I use one of the water inlets on the machine, because I don't really know what will happen if I use both. The instructions give you zero to go on with that. I just drop the end of the fill hose into the tub and turn on the sink faucet.<br /><br />If the hose won't fit any of your faucets, you'll need a bucket to fill the machine, or, as I've seen some users do, you could use a shower sprayer or a kitchen sink sprayer.<br /><br />The instructions say not to use the machine in any damp area, such as a bathroom or kitchen. Really? I would like someone to explain to me how to use a portable washing machine anywhere besides a bathroom or kitchen. I suppose if you have a washing machine hookup, you could use it there. But if you had that, you could probably buy a full size machine from a used appliance store for about the price of this portable one.<br /><br />All in all, I am happy. The mildew inside my machine was gross, but it didn't ruin my whole day. I'm washing clothes like mad, and I don't have to load up laundry baskets and take them to my mom's house or to a laundromat. It's fussy and it's not a heavy duty machine. But that's OK. My clothes are clean, and that's the whole point.<br /><br />TIPS:<br /><br />The drain setting on the Select Switch is only for the wash tub. Any water in the spin tub will always drain automatically. There is no way to prevent the spin tub from draining, even when the wash side of the machine is washing.<br /><br />When you're at the end of one wash load and spinning out your final rinse water, you can go ahead and start the next load in the wash tub. Just turn the wash dial to your setting so the wash tub will stop draining. The spin tub will still spin and drain while you're washing the next load.<br /><br />I do not use the fill inlet on the wash side of the tub. I drop the hose into the tub to fill it.<br /><br />If you can use the fill hose (if it fits your faucet), you can do something kind of cool that big washers do. Connect the loose end of the hose to the water inlet for the spin tub. Start your spin cycle. Then turn on the water for a few seconds at a time. That pours water into the spin tub to flush fresh water through the clothes as they spin. If you leave the water on for too long, it can spray out the top, so be careful about that. I tend to pulse it on and off for a few seconds at a time during the first minute or two of the spin.<br /><br />If you are concerned about conserving water, you can use this machine like the old twin tubs were designed to be used. REUSE YOUR WASH WATER! :)  You'll need to have a laundry basket handy to do this, but it works great for loads that aren't super dirty. Here's how you do it. Wash your first load. When it's done, do not turn the dial to \"Drain.\" Leave it where it is. Pick up some of the clothes from the wash tub and squeeze out some of the water into the wash tub. Just enough to keep from dragging tons of water across the machine. Put those clothes into the spin tub and spin them out. When those are done, put them into a laundry basket to get them out of your way. Put your next load into the same wash water as before and turn on the wash timer dial.<br /><br />If you don't use fabric softener (I use softener for clothes. I do not use softener for towels, because it makes them less absorbent) and if you can use your fill hose, you can do this another way. Wash your load, move it to the spin tub, then connect the hose to the water inlet on the spin tub. Add water as it spins. That way, you can rinse out the wash water as the clothes spin. Once that spin cycle is done, those clothes are washed AND rinsed, so they're completely done. No need to move them back to the wash tub for a full-tub rinse cycle.<br /><br />If you're lucky and can use the fill hose like I can, you'll want to be careful. It is not sturdy in ANY way. I can already tell that there will be a time before too long when the hose begins to crack at the ends. I'm already looking around for some replacement hose and connectors that I will be able to use when that happens.<br /><br />FILL HOSE WORK-AROUND:<br /><br />Not using a fill hose makes this machine a lot less convenient. If the hose will not work for you at all, but you do have a bathroom or kitchen faucet or shower head that's threaded (meaning you can screw on or unscrew to remove the faucet aerator or shower head), you can easily make a hose that will fit.<br /><br />Unscrew either the faucet aerator (the little tip at the end of the faucet) or remove the shower head. Take the aerator or shower head with you to your local hardware store or big box home improvement store. Talk to someone in plumbing. Most shower heads are universal, but you might want to take it with you just in case. Tell them what you're trying to do. Tell them that you need a connector to fit that size and style of connection so you can connect a standard garden hose to it. If you already know some plumbing, you can do this yourself. If not, they will be able to help you. If you don't know plumbing and grab any connector that you see, you might not get the right size.<br /><br />At home, you'll twist the connector that they gave you onto the faucet or the shower. Then you'll twist on the end of your garden hose to that connector. A cheap garden hose is probably best. They are smaller in diameter, and will fit the water inlet valves better. Cut off the other end of the hose to shorten the hose and to remove the metal or plastic connector at that end. If the hose is narrow enough, it might fit the water inlet valves on the machine. If not, it will still be a lot more convenient than using a bucket to fill the machine.\n",

      "Review 1971501:\n",
      "Text: **Note: This review is based off the 20.1 cubit ft (36\" wide) version of this model, but many of the same things apply to this unit.  Hope it's helpful!<br /><br />7/28/14<br />I have not been able to find any good reviews of this product, so I'm going to do my best to give one to help others as they consider buying this fridge. I know people want to know how a product lasts over time, so I'll do my best to remember to keep updating this review. As of today, the fridge has been up and running for 2 days.<br />It is important to note that our fridge is a B-stock unit (was returned by someone, but never used. They listed the reason as \"damaged packaging\"). We did not buy through this website.<br /><br />THE BACKSTORY<br />Our previous fridge was a big 36\" standard depth white GE side-to-side that someone gave us for free. We knew it was only a temporary solution, and started saving for its replacement for when it would die on us. The rest of our kitchen appliances were stainless, so we were looking forward to the day our big white fridge kicked the bucket so we could have a more uniform look. Yesterday, we got home from a trip and our fridge was making loud and scary noises that wouldn't stop. We saw this as the perfect excuse to make the switch.<br />I had heard of Fisher and Paykel before, and was told they were a good solution for a long-lasting fridge without all the unnecessary bells and whistles (that end up breaking and causing service calls down the road). I also thought this was the most elegant looking out of all of its competitors. I like the simple, flat look of this unit.<br />I headed over to our closest appliance outlet store and found a B-stock unit that was never used (still had the plastic wrap), but had a dent in the back. We saved a thousand dollars on this unit because of a dent nobody would ever see. Score!<br /><br />INSTALLATION<br />I took it home in my van and let it stand for 8 hours before turning it on (guy at store said this was important to do so all the liquids in the compressor could settle into place after transporting it on its back - better safe than sorry). During that time, I installed the included water filter and hoses to the fridge. It comes with everything you need except the piece that actually taps into your water line. Since we already had that from our previous fridge, this was a breeze. No need to call a plumber. The instruction manual was very easy to follow on installation of water components. I am the least handy guy you could know, so trust me when I say this was easy!<br />During the time the fridge sat unplugged, I also wiped down the shelves and bins, took off the plastic wrap, and read the instruction manual. I HIGHLY recommend reading the manual. There are so many features in this fridge that aren't highlighted on the companies website that I never would have known about had I not read the manual. I'll go into more detail in the \"Features\" Section of this review.<br />After the 8 hours, I plugged the fridge in and let it get to its proper temperature (about 2 hours). I used this time to adjust the front legs (it is supposed to be raised up 1/2\" higher in the front than the back for ease of door use). During this time, the exterior sides and back of the unit got HOT! Like, I'm afraid this thing is going to explode, hot. Thankfully after reaching its desired interior temps, the exterior cooled off substantially. Today, it isn't even warm. I made sure to run all the air pockets out of the water line, and discarded the first few batches of ice as instructed.<br /><br />FEATURES<br />First of all, keep in mind that we were previously using a big, standard depth side-by-side before, and have never had a counter-depth fridge, or one with a freezer on the bottom. Having made the transition, it is clear that these fridges are not for everyone. I'll try to explain in more detail as I go.<br />- Counter-Depth: This opened up our kitchen far beyond what we were expecting. I know its only a few inches shallower, but it made a huge difference for us. Our kitchen just got bigger and brighter! Our fridge is no longer the elephant in the room. This fridge looks great, but blends in. It does come with some trade offs. The depth of storage in the fridge is very shallow. For example, I don't see the ability to fit a large pizza box in the fridge or the freezer (untested theory).<br />- Doors: I've been to some peoples houses where their french doors were really hard to either open or close. These open with no problem, and close even easier. The freezer door is a bit harder to open than the fridge doors, but not difficult by any stretch.<br />- Hidden top hinges: I love how the top hinges are covered in the front. It is a small attention to detail which really makes this thing look clean and sharp. It also makes cleaning the top of the fridge so much easier!<br />- Water dispenser: Some people may not like that this doesn't have a door ice dispenser (ice is dispensed in a bin in the freezer). It is perfect for us, I love the shallow water chamber that doesn't cut into storage space on the inside door. It also is easier to clean, and you can fill any size container without worrying if it will fit. For us, the water comes out fast, and fills things up quickly. People who like to set a glass in the water cavity and walk away while it fills up will not like this feature. It is too shallow to set a glass in, you will need to hold it the entire time. Not a problem for us.<br />- Shelving: This model has 3 shelves (2 of which are height adjustable). These shelves go across the full width of the fridge. Some of this units competitors have adjustable shelves that only go halfway for more customization, but in my opinion that is just more breakable pieces, and it cuts into the amount of things you can store. The full-width shelves work perfectly for our needs. Also, many competitors' fridges have white plastic spill proofing around the edges of their shelves. In my opinion, this makes a fridge look cheap and flimsy. The ActiveSmart fridge has beautiful brushed metal spill proofing, it looks so much more elegant and uniform. Sounds like a small thing, but it is one of my favorite features!<br />- Door Storage: Because of the shallow water dispenser, you get full storage on both doors. This increases the storage like no other. There are large compartments with dividers for gallon sized jugs and tall items. At the top of each french door, there is a compartment with a lid for butters or cheeses. Our previous fridge had one of these compartments with a rounded lid, it really limited storage, but these have a squared off lid that allows you to stack items without worrying about closing the lid. My biggest complaint of this fridge is that these lids don't stay open when you lift them. So you need one hand to hold the lid open, and another to grab whatever is inside. It may sound negligible, but i'm usually holding something else when I need something from these compartments. Hopefully I'll get used to it. As of right now, it's really annoying.<br />- Wine/Bottle holders: There really isn't a place in this fridge where you would be able to store a wine bottle standing up other than the doors, so they included 4 horizontal holders that clip to the back of every shelf. These holders also stack upon another so if you don't have 4 bottles to hold, they don't take up a lot of room. Very thoughtful feature. If you insist on storing your wine or tall bottled drinks standing up, you may not like this fridge.<br />- REMOVABLE BINS!: This is my very favorite feature of this fridge. All drawers in the fridge and freezer are actually pull out shelves with clear bins sitting on top. This is so useful for so many reasons. Instead of shuffling through the vegetables or fruits to find what you are looking for with the fridge doors open, you can just pull out the desired bin and take it to the counter, find what you need and easily put it back. The same is true for meats/cheese bins, frozen drawers, and the ice bin. Saves tons of energy. Also, it makes cleaning drawers out a breeze. Just pull it out, rinse the bin in the sink, and dry out. I love this feature!<br />- Crisper drawers: Like most fridges, this has separate drawers for fruits and vegetables with a separate humidity setting for each. Keep in mind, you need to open both french doors to pull out the drawer. Even though there are two separate sections, the full drawer they share takes up the full width of the fridge. People who only want to open one door and pull out fruits or veggies will not like this fridge.<br />- Meats and Cheese Drawers: I like that there are two separate sections for these. We use the left one for lunch meat and cheeses, and the right one for other meats (steak, beef, fish, etc...). It is especially nice to use one of these as a dedicated meat thawing section without worry of any juices finding their way to other items in the fridge. Again, you need to open both french doors to access these compartments.<br />- Lighting: Our previous fridge had a light in the top back center. If we had anything in front of it (which was always), it would darken the rest of the fridge, making it difficult to see other items throughout. This fridge has a strip of LED lighting at the top front of the unit which allow for full illumination of the entire contents of the fridge no matter how you have your food arranged. Very nice touch! There are no lights on the doors, but enough spills from the inside of the fridge that you will be able to make out what you need even in the middle of the night.<br />- Ice machine: Since this is only our 2nd day, all I can say is it works as advertised so far. I know the ice machine is usually the biggest issue people have with any fridge, so I'll keep my eye on it and let you know if anything weird happens over time. The default setup is that in the freezer, there is a top shelf with 2 big bins across the width. In the left big bin, there is a smaller one that takes up half the width of that bin, and that is the ice bin. If you require more ice, you can just remove the smaller bin and let the ice dispense into the bigger bin. With either bin, it is supposed to stop producing ice when it is full. If you need even more ice, you can fill up the big bin on the left, switch it with the right bin, and fill up that one too. Lots of versatility, and the removable bins are great if you are entertaining!<br />- Freezer: The freezer has a top shelf that pulls out with the ice bin, plus a bin and a half of storage for other things. Then there is a large cavity below for the storage of everything else. If you are a person who usually packs out your freezer of your current fridge, I don't think you will enjoy a counter-depth freezer-on-the bottom model. This is definitely more for the person who has a larger ratio of fresh food to frozen food. I can easily see people needing to dig around the lower cavity if they over fill it. For our family, we don't need much freezer space, so it works perfect for us so far.<br />- Noise: As of right now, there is a constant hum that is about the volume of somebody whispering softly. It is audible, but not something you can hear unless you are in the kitchen. I'm not sure if this will always hum, or if it is just because we haven't filled up our ice bin to the top yet, and the ice machine is constantly working. I'll update the review when we find out.<br />- ActiveSmart Tech: I don't really know what it is, other than it's supposed to do a good job of keeping your food cold. Mission accomplished so far.<br />- Other features: Sabbath mode, open door alarm (90 seconds for fridge, 60 seconds for freezer), ability to turn off open door alarm (for cleaning), water dispenser lock (for cleaning or curious kids), ice bin on/off, fast ice, temperature controls, bottle chill function (allows you to chill a beverage quickly in freezer, and will sound alarm when it is done), fast freeze (for quick freezing of fresh food), water filter replacement indicator, lock fridge controls (for cleaning) and others I'm sure I'm forgetting. Fridge controls are located inside the fridge.<br /><br />WHO WOULD LOVE THIS FRIDGE<br />People who:<br />- Have more fresh food than frozen food<br />- Don't need to store extra deep items (large pizza box, for example)* SEE UPDATES<br />- Appreciate removable storage bins<br />- Like sleek, simple, modern design<br />- Want to maximize the storage of the inside of their fridge<br />- Like good lighting<br />- Want to be able to fill pitchers and other large containers from the door water dispenser<br />- Want easy opening and closing doors<br />- Want to be able to view everything in their fridge at a glance without needing to move things out of the way.<br /><br />WHO WOULD NOT LIKE THIS FRIDGE<br />People who<br />- Want a door ice dispenser<br />- Want exterior controls<br />- Have need for lots of freezer space<br />- Need to store deep items (large pizza box, for example) *SEE UPDATES<br />- Want all the latest buzzword appliance features<br />- Want to be able to access fruit/veggie/meat/cheese drawers with only one french door open<br />- Want completely silent operation* SEE UPDATES<br /><br />I hope that is helpful!<br /><br />***UPDATE 7/30/14***<br />I was finally able to test my pizza box theory.  A large Little Caesars Hot N' Ready box WILL fit in the fridge.  Just know that you need to lift it above the back lip of the shelf (about 1/2\" high) and push it as far as it goes.  It is just the right size.  I still don't see a convenient way to fit a large pizza box in the freezer.<br />The constant whisper hum seems to have gotten quieter as the days go by. I still haven't completely filled my ice bin, so still can't say if the noise will stop once the ice machine stops.<br />Still loving the fridge!<br /><br />***UPDATE 8/4/14***<br />Ice bin is full and the noise has stopped.  Outside of the normal kicking back on to make more ice, or return internal temperatures to where they should be, this thing is silent.  Still loving the fridge!<br /><br />***UPDATE 2/19/15***<br />I've now owned this fridge for about 6 months, and figured people may appreciate an update.  Here are some thoughts:<br />- Still silent in operation.  Every now and then there is a whisper noise that lasts no longer than 20 seconds.  By every now and then, I mean once or twice a month.  I don't know what causes it, but I don't think it is anything defective.  Just sounds like a machine doing it's thing.<br />- 1 gallon milk jugs just barely fit in the doors (the only place for them).  They fit, however they take a little pushing.<br />- In my original review, I complain about the top butter storage compartments in the doors. We got used to them really fast, and it doesn't feel inconvenient anymore.<br />- We replaced the water filter just this week, and it was so easy.  No need to turn off water going to your fridge, just unscrew the old one, and pop in the new one.<br />- Spill guards on shelving do their jobs!  We've had some spills, and they were very easy to clean!<br />- Still can't say enough on how much I love the removable bins.  So easy for cleaning!<br />- Our family keeps growing, and even though this is a counter-depth fridge, we never seem to be out of space in there.<br />- Now that our little guy is crawling, there are tons of fingerprints on all our stainless appliances.  This fridge has more of a matte finish, and the fingerprints are drastically reduced compared to our other appliances.<br />Bottom line: I am absolutely happy with my purchase 6 months later.  It is still a talking point when people come in our kitchen, and it does everything I want it to.\n",

      "Text: Love this machine! When I found out that washing/drying clothes doesn't completely kill off COVID (just reduces the amount of virus), I decided I didn't want to use my apartment building's community machines.<br /><br />I wish I had bought the machine sooner! It takes up some space in my admittedly small NYC apt, but it's totally worth it. I keep it in my tiny bathroom which works fine since it's just me living here. And I'm saving scads of money...it's paying for itself in just a few months. It's also so much easier than lugging down clothes to the basement. I'm finding myself doing a quick, small load regularly instead of a couple of giant loads every 1-2 weeks...& laundry feels like a breeze this way.<br /><br />After researching various machines, this is the one that had the best ratings & I can see why...it's the largest size & has an electric drain pump (as opposed to a gravity drain) which makes a HUGE difference!<br /><br />In order to thank the laundry gods for this wonderful find, I've written up everything I wish I had known about the machine below including answers to questions I had, complete instructions, tips, & how to clean the machine once a month to prevent mold/mildew/bad smell/soap buildup.<br /><br />Happy washing!<br /><br />WHAT SIZE OF WASHER SHOULD YOU GET?<br /><br />The best way to first decide what size of machine to get is to weigh & measure a typical load of your laundry. The washer says it can handle 18 lbs of clothes, but the interior size of the tub is only 14\"x16\"x18\" (a little less than that actually cause there are some protuberances in the tub) & you only want to fill up the tub halfway with water to prevent machine strain so that means the size of each load is even smaller. (Also, you can only add up to 8lbs of clothes in the spin dryer which normally means you're dividing up the clothes you've washed into 2 groups to spin dry.)<br /><br />Then, decide how often you're willing to run the machine & what you want to wash. I live alone in a small NYC apt so I could have gotten a smaller machine. But I wanted to be able to wash everything I own including blankets & I also didn't want to have to run the machine often. I think I chose the correct size for me, but I can also see how someone in a small apt like mine might choose to get a smaller size & just run the washer more often while having a cleaner wash things like blankets. If we weren't in pandemic times, that's what I'd do. But now, knowing that COVID isn't completely killed in the washer/dryer (the amount of virus is just reduced) means that a cleaner doesn't feel like a safe choice to me.<br /><br />Note: I can wash my queen lighter-weight blanket in this just fine. A medium-weight blanket might work though you might have to only use the washer side & not the spin dry side (& therefore have to hand wring out the item, but that's not terrible since you normally don't wash these as often.) There's no way a comforter or heavy blanket would work in it...but you could invest in a duvet cover for the comforter/blanket & just wash the duvet cover.<br /><br />HOW LONG DOES IT REALLY TAKE TO DO A WASH/SPIN DRY?<br /><br />It comes down to preference (i.e., how long you like to wash your clothes, how dirty your clothes are, how you rinse & how many times, & how many times you spin dry).<br /><br />It takes me approximately 42 minutes:<br /><br />3 minutes to add water<br />15 minutes to wash<br />1 minute to drain<br />3 minutes to add water for rinsing<br />5 minutes to rinse<br />1 minute to drain<br />2 minutes to add reduced amount of water for 2nd rinse in spin dryer<br />5 minutes to spin dry to get 80-85% dry<br />5 minutes to spin dry a 2nd time to get 90-95% dry<br />2 minutes misc in between the above for adding/moving/removing clothes<br /><br />DOES IT WORK IF YOU HAVE PETS?<br /><br />I have 2 cats which leave lots of fur everywhere. Usually, a washer/dryer helps to remove fur. This machine doesn't do as good of a job since it's really the drying cycle in a regular dryer which removes pet hair & this doesn't have a drying cycle, just a spin cycle. My workaround is a combo of the following:<br /><br />Do 2 rinse cycles including 1 in the washer tub (I need to rinse twince anyway so not a problem)<br />Use the Fourlove 2020 New Washing Machine Hair Filter Cleaning Mesh Bag Home Floating Lint Hair Catcher https://www.amazon.com/Washing-Machine-Cleaning-Floating-Reusable/dp/B08FXB7YX4<br />Brush my cats a little more often so I collect their hair on the brush instead of on my clothes<br />Remove some hair from my clothes with a lint roller. (It's now a part of my process to \"de-catify\" my clothes before putting them in the hamper every day & I also de-catify the cats fav spots to sleep too once or twice a week. I use re-usable rollers: the iLifeTech Resuable Lint Roller 8\" & the ChomChom Roller. They both work well, but for different things. The ChomChom works better on flat surfaces.)<br /><br />HOW LOUD IS IT?<br /><br />It's a tiny bit louder than a regular washer/dryer, but it's not crazy loud. You can reduce the noise/vibrations by placing 4 large sponges under each leg.<br /><br />WILL I HAVE A PROBLEM IF MY BUILDING DOESN'T ALLOW WASHERS?<br /><br />You'll have to make your own decision on this, but the very large box does clearly state \"Washing Machine\" on it. However, it is far smaller & far lighter than a washing machine.<br /><br />ARE CLOTHES MORE WRINKLED THIS WAY?<br /><br />Not for me. Because you're hanging up clothes that are still a little wet, clothes seem to dry without wrinkles especially if you tug them straight as you're hanging them up.<br /><br />CAN I JUST USE THE SPIN SIDE FOR HAND WASHED ITEMS?<br /><br />Yes.<br /><br />COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS<br /><br />(Seems like a lot of steps, but it's much faster than a regular washer I promise. +Once you wash your clothes for the 1st time, you won't need these instructions again.)<br /><br />1. To reduce noise & vibration (especially useful in apts), place the washer on 4 sponges with each sponge under the legs. (You can also put the washer in your tub if you wish, but that's not what I do. Whatever you do, you have to ensure that the cord doesn't get wet so a stand would be necessary if placing in the tub.)<br /><br />2. Take the larger hose that's connected to the washer & place it into a toilet or tub. (The toilet will flush itself when it gets too full.) Then, SECURE THE HOSE WELL cause that's the drain hose & water will come out of it fast during the drain/spin cycles! I wedged it into my tub's soap holder that's caulked into the wall. Others have placed the toilet lid with a weight on top over the hose, while others have tied the hose in place over the sink/tub/toilet.<br /><br />3. Take the smaller hose which was shipped inside the spin cycle side of the washer & connect the wider end to your faucet tightening it in place with the metal clamp included with the instructions. (You'll have to place the hose through the clamp.) Then, place the narrower end to the top left of the washer. Note: This hose may not fit your faucet & if it doesn't, you'll have to buy a connector which fits...or you can use a shower head with a hose attachment placed directly into the washer tub. You can also fill up the washer manually using a bucket or hold the hose in place with your hand. Even if the hose does fit, the majority of the time, it won't stay in place even with the clamp...that's what happened to me & water went everywhere. (I highly suggest you stay by the machine the 1st time you run it just to confirm no issues occur.)<br /><br />4. Turn on your faucet at the temperature you want to wash the clothes in adding water into the machine. (I wouldn't do it really hot as the hose is plastic.) Fill up the machine as much as you want, but remember you also have to put clothes in it afterwards. Then, turn off the faucet. Note: Generally, you don't want to strain the machine by filling it up with water more than halfway.<br /><br />5. Place liquid detergent inside. (Powder doesn't seem to work as well.) Don't use a lot of liquid detergent or it will take you forever to rinse your clothes. I use about 1/3 of the cup that comes with my detergent for a full load. (I drop the liquid a little high up so it blends better with the water from the get go.)<br /><br />6. Add your clothes. It says it can handle 18 lbs of clothes max, but the interior size of the tub is only 14\"x16\"x18\" (a little less than that actually cause there are some protuberances in the tub) & you want your clothes to have a lot of water covering them. With the tub only filled half way with water & a weight limit you should try to be well under in order to prevent machine strain, each load won't be huge like a regular washer. If you're washing heavy things like jeans, you have to add in fewer clothes. If you push the machine too much, it will break.<br /><br />7. If you bought a floating lint/hair catcher, add it. (I urge you to get one. The one I use is Fourlove 2020 New Washing Machine Hair Filter Cleaning Mesh Bag Home Floating Lint Hair Catcher https://www.amazon.com/Washing-Machine-Cleaning-Floating-Reusable/dp/B08FXB7YX4)<br /><br />8. Close the washer lid & plug the machine in.<br /><br />9. Turn the wash selector dial (the middle dial) to normal or delicate. Note: The dials are harder to turn then you think. Then, turn the wash timer dial (the left dial) to however many minutes you want to wash your clothes (max of 15 min). The washer will then do the work by itself.<br /><br />10. When the wash cycle is done, turn the washer dial to drain. It's quick & water can easily go everywhere so stay next to it while it drains. You'll know it's drained when you start hearing a repetitive, sucking sound & little to no water comes out. Once the washer is drained, turn the dial back to normal or delicate. Note: If your clothes are extremely dirty, you may have to do a 2nd wash cycle.<br /><br />11. Rinsing your clothes comes down to preference. Personally, I like to do the rinse cycle in the washer & then a 2nd rinse cycle in the spin dryer. (I do this because I feel like the spin dryer doesn't agitate the water long enough to rinse before spinning dry. +I feel like this reduces the amount of soap buildup in the washer.) To do your rinse cycle in the spin dryer only, skip ahead to #10. Otherwise, here's how to do the 1st rinse cycle in the washer: With your clothes still in the washer, fill the washer back up with water till the water generously covers them & then turn off the faucet. Add in fabric softener if you use it agitating the water by hand so it mixes in. Note: I've found my clothes don't really need fabric softener so I no longer use it. Turn the timer for however long you'd like to rinse your clothes. (I usually do 5 minutes.) Drain the water again & turn the dial back to normal or delicate.<br /><br />12. Move your clothes to the spin side placing the \"heaviest\" garment at the bottom. (Remove the floating lint/hair catcher if you bought one & used it.) You also need to make sure you balance the load well so the weight is distributed evenly. Note: You can't shove all the clothes you washed in there at one time unless you washed a very small load cause the spin dryer can only take 8 lbs of laundry whereas the washer can handle 18 lbs. Then, move your faucet hose from the left side of the washer to the right next to the spin dryer. Put the plastic topper disc directly on top of your clothes underneath the rim of the spin tub. (Seems like it's not needed, but it really is.)<br /><br />13. Add in water to soak the clothes. After the spin side has filled up to your desired level, turn off water. Push the clothes down to make sure the water's soaked through. Then, turn the spin timer dial (the right dial) to however many minutes you want the clothes to spin (up to 5 min; I always use 5). Note: If you've used too much detergent & the water coming out is still soapy towards the end of the cycle, you'll need to do another rinse re-filling the tub.<br /><br />14. When the spin-dry cycle is complete, the clothes will be about 80-85% dry (assuming you used a 5 min cycle). At that point, you can hang them up to dry, or take them out to separate them & place them back into the dryer for a 2nd spin cycle (without adding any water) to get them 90-95% dry. I do this 2nd spin when I have the time, but it's not necessary as the clothes will still easily dry in less than a day. (Lighter clothes can easily dry within 6 hours.) As you're hanging them up to dry, pull them straight so they aren't wrinkled.<br /><br />Apartment dwellers: I love the Household Essentials 5012-1 Portable 2-Tier Clothes Drying Rack Tri-pod (large) to hang up the clothes to dry as the device is compact, can easily be adjusted, you can place clothes on hangers on it (up to 36), & then easily fold the rack away when done. It's plastic so you can't put tons of heavy things on each arm, but it still holds a good amount. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z91A88/ I also have large adhesive hooks that I've added to my walls & then attach super light line to them when I want to dry sheets.<br /><br />15. Leave the lids open on the washer/spin dryer to allow them to dry out. This helps prevents mold/mildew/bad smells.<br /><br />16. Shake out the drain hose & use gravity to drain out any remaining water. Put the open end of the drain hose in a flat container like an aluminum pan down on the floor to help drain out the last of the water with gravity. Note: Some folks place the washer on an elevated surface to help with draining & I think I will be getting a stand for this myself...I also think it may help with removing lint/cat hair from the drain hose. Other folks buy 4 caster wheels with brakes attaching them to a wood dolly so they can easily move it around, but I don't find that necessary.<br /><br />17. Unplug the washer.<br /><br />18. Clean out the inside of the filter. You'll see it on the left inside of the tub. (You don't have to do this every time as it doesn't work very well.<br /><br />ONCE A MONTH, CLEAN THE WASHER TO PREVENT MOLD/MILDEW/BAD SMELLS/SOAP BUILDUP<br /><br />You can choose to use either bleach or white vinegar to clean it BUT DON'T EVER MIX THE TWO AS THAT CAN CREATE LETHAL CHORLINE GAS! Bleach is more powerful & is a mold & bacteria-killer. Vinegar is a natural choice. Decide which one to use & only use that in your machine from then on.<br /><br />1. Fill the washer halfway up with very warm water (no detergent). Note: I don't ever use hot water as the hoses are plastic.<br /><br />2. Add 4 cups of vinegar OR bleach (never both!) to the water.<br /><br />3. Close the lid & run the washing cycle for 15 minutes.<br /><br />4. Drain.<br /><br />5. If there are any stains or grime left, then scrub the inside of the machine as necessary using a 50/50 ratio of water mixed with whatever you used previously (i.e., bleach or vinegar--never both). Don’t use a scouring pad or anything abrasive as this will damage the machine.<br /><br />6. Re-fill halfway with warm water, add detergent, & then re-run the 15-minute cycle before draining again.<br /><br />7. Want to keep the machine as clean as possible? Drain out as much water as you can after each wash/spin cycle. (Putting the machine up on a stand can help the drain hose do its job better.) Always keep the lids open so the machine completely dries in between uses. Empty your clothes from the machine as soon as possible. Ever notice a musty smell in a washer? That’s a sign of mold. The longer you leave damp clothes sitting in the machine, the greater the chances of mold.\n",

      "Review 798376:\n",
      "Text: I absolutely hate this washer. I've owned it for 18 months now and every time I use it I regret the purchase. Here are some of the reasons I hate it.<br /><br />1. It uses waaaaay too little water. When I bought it the salesman told me that the machine fills to the top of the clothes plus 1 gallon. That is simply not true. The clothes stick out above the top of the water by 9 inches. The water level is slightly adjustable by the soil level setting but this only changes the level by an inch or two. I have experimented for hours to try to increase the water level - the machine is determined to keep the level low probably so that they can get their highest-level energy star rating. Now you may think that it is a good thing for it to use too little water but when you see how harsh it is on your clothes (item 2 below) and how wrinkled the clothes get (item 4 below) you will change your mind.<br /><br />2. It is extremely harsh on clothes. When I bought it the salesman told me that the machine is more gentle than older style agitator machines. That is completely untrue. This washer pills clothes visibly with every single wash. Brand new towels appear old and worn after a few washes. Here is why it is so harsh. The clothes throughout the load are wet but they are not submerged in water. Only the bottom of the load is submerged in water. The washer tries to pull the clothes up and down into and out of the water at the bottom. It does so by twisting and spinning them, similar to the way clothes are twisted when you wring them out. This is harmful for clothes. When clothes are submerged in water (as in older washers) the water acts as a cushion against rubbing. The water is moved by the agitator and the clothes glide around in it. The higher the water-to-clothes ratio the more gentle it is on the clothes. The lower the water-to-clothes ratio, the more tightly the clothes are packed and the more abrasive the rubbing is. This washer is the most extreme case of a low water-to-clothes ratio because the clothes aren't even submerged at all. They are wet and rubbing hard against one another. To make matters worse the wringing action, which is done very tightly, is very harmful for anything but the sturdiest of fabrics. Imagine taking a wet shirt and twisting it as hard as you can from end to end in a wringing action. This is what clothes endure during each load.<br /><br />3. There is no way to wash delicates in this washer. For all the reasons mentioned in 2, there is no setting on this washer that is acceptable for delicate clothes. The handwash cycle on this washer is much harsher than the normal cycle was on my old washer. None of my work clothes can tolerate it.<br /><br />4. Clothes come out incredibly wrinkled, twisted, and knotted. As mentioned in 2, this washer needs to twist and knot items to move them in and out of the water. When the load is done they remain this way. Bras are all knotted together in one giant mess that takes forever to undo. I have to first shake items out to untwist them and then dry them on a higher heat setting than I would otherwise use to get the wrinkling out. Use of the lower-speed spin cycle doesn't really help much because the problem is largely due to the washing portion of the cycle. The high-speed spin cycle only sets the twisting in even harder.<br /><br />5. There is no way to change washer settings after the load has started. How many times have you started a load and then decided, \"oops I'd rather use handwash\" or \"I'd rather use high-speed spin after all\". Well forget about changing your mind on this washer. This washer goes through an extensive calibration cycle at the beginning of each load to figure out how much water to use. The calculations it does during this time are based on the cycle settings such as soil level, load type, etc. It can't let you change settings once the calibration cycle has started because its calculations will get messed up. Maytag says that all you need to do is press cancel and restart but what makes this so incredibly annoying is that cancel drains all the water from the washer. It often happens to me that I want to change settings after the washer is partly full of water plus soap. To make a setting change I have to throw away the entire load of water and soap. You wouldn't believe the amount of water I've wasted because of needing to press cancel.<br /><br />6. The soak cycle wastes water and soap because once the soak cycle is complete there is no way to continue using the same water to complete a wash. It gives you no option but to drain the entire tub after the soak cycle. Then when you want to wash you have to refill it again and add more soap.<br /><br />7. The calibration cycle takes a long time. As mentioned in 5, this washer goes through an extensive calibration cycle at the beginning of each load to figure out how much water to use. It takes about 5 minutes and makes the cycle take that much longer with the only benefit that it is deciding on the \"optimal\" amount of water to use. I would much rather have the level manually selectable and the cycle 5 minutes shorter.<br /><br />8. The electronic smarts are very limiting and annoying. The salesman told me \"this washer is so great that it won't allow you to damage your delicates\". What he meant is that the washer limits your options depending on what cycle you have selected. So for example, if you have the washer set to the handwash agitation, it won't let you use high-speed spin or let you use warm water. Or if you use the soak cycle it wont let you use hot water. Or if you use the soak cycle there is no way to get delicate agitation. There is no way to override their setting limits. How ridiculous! I know better than some engineer at Maytag what options are appropriate for me. To think that they advertise this as a feature?!?<br /><br />9. The lid locks. Sometimes when washing delicates I like to be able to keep the lid open during agitation so that I can assist with special pieces. This washer won't allow any cycle to continue with the lid open although I did find a way to bypass the lid lock function.<br /><br />10. There is only one positive thing about this washer. I like the glass lid because it lets me see how harshly the washer is twisting my clothes.<br /><br />Some reviewers here have commented that maybe I did not properly follow the instructions about how to distribute clothes within the washer. That is not true. I read and follow the instructions perfectly - it doesn't help.<br /><br />The first day after I got this washer I tried to return it but the store wouldn't take it back. I called Maytag and begged them to tell me how to increase the water level. I tried to pay a service person to increase the water level. I kept being told there is absolutely no way to increase the water level.<br /><br />I am an electrical engineer and I got so frustrated with Maytag that I spent about 8 hours working out a way to make the water level on this washer adjustable. It requires adding a potentiometer (variable resistor) to the control board that is accessible from the top of the washer. The potentiometer adds an offset of water to the level. Right now I have it set to add an extra 10 inches of water so that the clothes are completely but just barely submerged. It makes a huge difference in wear and tear on clothes and makes the handwash cycle usable. The washer is now just barely bearable. If you want to use my technique for adjusting water level, email me at sueonline@gmail.com and I'd be more than happy to share the method with you (for free). I even have pictures showing the control board modification.<br /><br />UPDATE: Since I posted this review I have recieved about 1500 emails from people who purchased this washer and are searching online for how to increase the water level. They come across my review and email me. I hear the same story over and over again from them. They bought this washer and hate it fiercely. They are tired of clothes coming out still dirty and are tired of their fabrics getting destroyed. They want help increasing the water level. I am including below some examples of the email responses I've gotten to my review. I have not edited these emails - these are the exact words of others.<br /><br />\"Sue -- read you review and I have only had mine for 8 mos but my towels are just coming apart from the abuse -- It was the topic of discussion at the hair salon the other day.  Several of  the customers like me have that washer.  Everyone wants to know what to do.  At first I thought -- this is awesome -- my clothes are cleaner but not now.  Please send me a \"how to\" increase the water.  Thx\"<br /><br /> \"I have a Bravo XL and hate it!! I was soo happy to come accrossed your review I read it to my husband, and he would love it if you could send us how to increase the water level? I'm tired of having to throw clothes away!\"<br /><br />\"Kudos to you for a comprehensive break-down of frustration of the Maytag BRAVOS!  Bravo for nothing - this machine is the bane of my existence.  It is ruining our clothes and gone are the days when we could simply dry laundry on the line - now every last bit has to be 'fluffed' in the dryer to remove the annoying wrinkles!

Please help me.\"<br /><br /> \"Thank you for your review on the Maytag Bravos washing machine.  I'm not sure you realize how helpful your review on this product was.  Unfortunately for me I didn't research this product as well as I should have and the LOW LOW lured me in.  I'm about 1 month in from buying this set of \"clothes destroyers\" and kick myself everytime I go to do a load of laundry for not researching this better.  I believe the industry has fooled a majority of us consumers into believing that \"saving the planet\" by using less water is a good thing - I guess I beg to differ since I'll have to spend more money on new clothes, sheets and towels.  As an added note to the issue you mention I am now noticing (having never had this occur before with my washer of 15 years) that some of my clothes are coming out with what appear to be brown BURN marks.  I first noticed a pillowcase with a brown line on it - thinking it was dirt - I scratched my fingernail gently on it the fabric and the fabric disintigated/broke apart!  This was NOT bleach as some might say; they are red sheets and bleach came nowhere near these.  My guess is that the harsh rubbing/wringing action from the washer is creating a very strong friction and causing \"burns\" on some of my garments.  Glad I'm saving so much on my water bill with this machine that only uses about 3 gallons per large load, as - I'll now need to save that money for new clothes/linens that I'll need to buy more frequently.\"<br /><br />\"Thank you so much for your Amazon review of the Bravos....I am not an engineer but I could have written your review!

This washer is like taking your clothes to the river and beating them on a rock. My garden hose is outside the laundry room door; I have considered filling the washer myself! I have problems with stains, smells, towels getting \"pulls\". Delicate? Handwash? Good luck! And why does the \"soak\" cycle agitate?!!!\"<br /><br />\"I agree with your entire post!

Could you please send the water adjustment and computer map.\"<br />\"Thank you so much for taking the time to write your post on Amazon. This washing machine is terrible, no wonder it was on sale. Makes me wish for old rusted noisy washer daily as atleast that got the clothing clean. If you could please share how to override the lid lock feature and how to make the water level higher would be very appreciative.\"<br /><br />\"I was so happy to find your review of the Maytag Bravos washer on Amazon.  I too have this washer and share the same frustrations.  I have missed my \"old fashioned\" washer since the first wash!  My family and I spent the holidays with family out of state who had a machine that actually fills up with water and allows you to manipulate settings.  This was the highlight of my vacation...lol!\"<br /><br />\"Hello,I read your review on amazon.com and would really appreciate your information on how to increase the water level. I bought the machine 5 days ago and completely agree with your review.\"<br /><br />\"We read your review on the Bravos Maytag washing maching and totally agree. I have had mine about the same amount of time and I am completed frustrated. It just doesn't wash the clothing. If you would be so kind as to send us your fix, we would greatly appreciate it. My husband is a mechanical engineer and will happily rip into it; otherwise, I may just go back to my old machine in the basement.\"<br /><br />\"could you please send me your instructions on how to fix my piece of junk washing machine?... is this something that i could have an electrician fix easily?... thanks so much for your help...\"<br /><br />\"Your description of the water level problem is almost word for word my own, ion all its detail. If you can help, I would like to try to make the fix -- assuming a simple home workshop kind of guy can do it with your help.\"<br /><br />\"I saw online your review of the Bravos XL washing macine. We share you critic of this Maytag model. Could you please email us as to how you modified the Maytag to allow a higher water fill level. It would be much appreciated. I would like to modify the Maytag to make it useable. Thanks in advance.\"<br /><br />\"Thanks for the post on Amazon about the Brovos XL Washer. I'm very frustrated with all the points you laid out. If I could increase the water level that would be a great benefit and maybe I can live with the forced settings.\"\n",
